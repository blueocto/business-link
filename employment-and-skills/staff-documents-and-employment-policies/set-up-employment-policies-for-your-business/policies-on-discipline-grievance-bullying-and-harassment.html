            <h1>Set up employment policies for your business</h1>
            <h2>Policies on discipline, grievance, bullying and harassment</h2>
            <p>You are required by law to set out your disciplinary rules and disciplinary and grievance procedures, in writing.</p>
            <p>It's also common for employers to have a separate bullying and harassment policy.</p>
            <h3>Discipline and grievance policies</h3>
            <p>You must tell each employee about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>your disciplinary rules</li>
                <li>your disciplinary/dismissal and grievance procedure</li>
                <li>the name of the person to whom they should appeal if they are unhappy about a disciplinary or dismissal decision, or to seek redress for a grievance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This information can be included in the employee's written statement or the written statement may refer the employee to a document where they can read it, eg in a staff handbook.</p>
            <p><a href="http://online.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/stmtEmpLanding?topicId=1075225309" title="Use our interactive tool to create a document including everything you have to give your new employee in writing">Use our interactive tool to create a written statement of employment</a>.</p>
            <p>If you fail to issue this information in writing, and one of your employees makes an employment tribunal case against you and wins, you may have to pay up to four weeks' wages on top of any other compensation the tribunal may award.</p>
            <p>
                <p>It's important that your disciplinary rules give examples of the types of behaviour that qualify as gross misconduct, eg fighting, bullying and stealing. If you find that an employee has committed an act of gross misconduct, you could be entitled to dismiss them immediately without notice or pay in lieu of notice.</p>
                <p>See our guides on <a href="layerdc43.html?topicId=1074207501" title="How to take fair and prompt disciplinary action against an employee">disciplinary procedures, hearings and appeals</a>, <a href="layer22f7.html?topicId=1081705989" title="How to keep staff and maintain morale by resolving grievances effectively and quickly">handling grievances</a> and <a href="layer1c63.html?topicId=1074200615" title="Understand the issues around dismissing staff and how to manage the process fairly and correctly">dismissal</a>.</p>
            </p>
            <h3>Bullying and harassment</h3>
            <p>Bullying and harassment are conduct issues and therefore would normally fall under your disciplinary policy. However, many employers have a separate bullying and harassment policy given that such behaviour:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>needs dealing with sensitively </li>
                <li>can amount to gross misconduct</li>
                <li>may involve unlawful discrimination</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <p><strong>Bullying</strong> is not in itself unlawful. However, you have a legal duty to protect the health and safety of your workers. Bullying can also lead to a breakdown in trust and confidence between you and the supposed victim, leading to the employee resigning and claiming constructive dismissal.</p>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Sexual harassment</strong> and <strong>harassment</strong> on the grounds of sex, disability, race, sexual orientation, religion/belief and age are unlawful. Even if a worker harasses a colleague, the victim can make a discrimination claim against you.</p>
            <p>You should have a clear policy on bullying and harassment so staff understand that it's unacceptable. The policy should also include a procedure for dealing with claims of harassment or bullying should they arise.</p>
