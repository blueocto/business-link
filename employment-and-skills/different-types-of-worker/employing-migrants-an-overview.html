            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>British citizens and nationals of most countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland do not need permission to live and work in the UK, and can be employed without restriction. However, nationals of Bulgaria and Romania may need to register with or get authorisation from the UK Border Agency (UKBA) to work in the UK legally, and you may need to obtain a work permit for them.</p>
            <p>Most nationals of countries outside Europe must apply to the UKBA under the points-based system for UK immigration if they want to live and work here. If you want to employ them, you may need to be their 'sponsor' during their stay. You may also be able to employ asylum seekers, if they have permission to work here.</p>
            <p>This guide outlines the process of employing migrants and the points-based system for immigration, including sponsor's duties, categories and tiers of migrants, how to apply for a sponsor licence and the sponsorship management system. It is aimed at UK-based employers who wish to employ a migrant worker.</p>
