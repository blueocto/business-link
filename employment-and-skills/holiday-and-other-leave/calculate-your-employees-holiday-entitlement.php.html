            <p>A worker is entitled to 5.6 weeks paid annual leave. This entitlement starts from their first day of employment.</p>
            <p>This tool enables you to calculate a worker's current and future statutory paid annual leave entitlement - also known as holiday pay - based on the set number of days or hours they work per week.</p>
            <p><strong>This tool is not suitable for people who work:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>six days a week - the statutory entitlement of such workers is capped at 28 days</strong></li>
                <li><strong>a different number of hours from one week to the next</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>For guidance on calculating the holiday entitlement or workers with irregular working hours, see the page on <a href="detailedf6.html?itemId=1074414843&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="How to work out statutory paid annual leave for part-time staff, shift workers, casual workers and others">calculating holiday entitlement for atypical workers</a> in our guide on <a href="detailedf6.html?itemId=1074414843&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="How to work out statutory paid annual leave for part-time staff, shift workers, casual workers and others">how much holiday to give your staff</a>.</p>
