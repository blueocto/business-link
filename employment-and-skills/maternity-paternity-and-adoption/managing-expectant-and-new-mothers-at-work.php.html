            <p>If you are an employer with a new or expectant mother among your staff, but you're not sure what your employee is entitled to in terms of leave, pay and associated benefits, this interactive tool can help you to ensure you act properly and within the law at every turn.</p>
            <p>By answering a simple series of questions, we can provide most employers with a clear idea of their responsibilities to new or expectant mothers and some best practice guidance.</p>
            <p>This tool is not a substitute for professional advice. You may also want to consult a professional, trade association or the relevant government department.</p>
