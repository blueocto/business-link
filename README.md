So, I've been working on this is my spare time for many years. Ever since the government ditched the great resource that was Business Link - just after a Â£million re-design - I've strived to bring it back to it's former glory.

I'm now at a point where it is becoming more useable and readable, so you can view the live development link at http://alpha.venturelabs.org.uk

### How you can help

- I need the ability to search the website; I've tried to avoid using Wordpress at this point
- I need fresh imagery for sections
- I need someone to ensure the information given is accurate and up-to-date
- I need the ability to create an XML file for SEO purposes

### Updates

I've thought it an idea to update this when a section is completed to show progression.

| Date     | Progression                                                                                                                                                             |
