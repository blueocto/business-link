			<h1>Renting business premises</h1>
			<h2>Types of property rental agreement</h2>
			<p>You can rent business premises by leasing them. If you require premises for a short term - for instance, to complete a large order - then consider a licence rather than a lease.</p>
			<h3>Leasing</h3>
			<p>Leases typically have agreements of between three and 25 years and can offer long-term stability. However, lease lengths are getting shorter and recent research suggests that the average length of a business lease is below eight years.</p>
			<p>You will probably be able to negotiate this with your landlord and should certainly check before signing the contract.</p>
			<p>The Code for Leasing Business Premises helps promote fairness in commercial leases. Although the code is voluntary, its use is strongly supported and monitored by the government. The code contains useful advice that can help you negotiate favourable lease terms if your landlord does not offer a code-compliant lease. <a href="http://www.leasingbusinesspremises.co.uk/" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Gwybodaeth am brydlesu safle busnes ar wefan Leasing Business Premises">Read the Code for Leasing Business Premises on the Leasing Business Premises website</a>.</p>
			<p>Other than the rent itself, key areas of the contract that you should study include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>lease length</li>
				<li>break clauses</li>
				<li>service charges</li>
				<li>dilapidations (an amount payable to the landlord at the end of the lease)</li>
				<li>responsibility for maintenance and repairs to the building and external areas</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Lease length</h3>
			<p>Rent is usually paid quarterly in advance. However, you may be able to pay monthly. This can form part of negotiations with your landlord. If your business is new, you may want to consider a short lease of three years or less or ask for a break clause.</p>
			<h3>Service charges</h3>
			<p>Check how much these are and what services they cover, such as cleaning and heating. Establish what facilities you may be sharing with other tenants. Service charges are an additional cost to the rent and can be more expensive than if you organise them yourself. You have the right to challenge service charges. <a href="http://www.servicechargecode.co.uk/" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk">Find a code of good practice on service charges on the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) website</a>.</p>
			<p>You have the right to remain in occupation of the premises and renew the lease once it expires, unless you and your landlord have agreed otherwise. However, there are specific cases when the landlord can refuse to grant a renewal. Read our guide on <a href="layere21e.html?topicId=1084383349" title="The rights of tenants and landlords to end or renew a business tenancy and the help and advice available">renewing and ending your business lease</a>.</p>
			<h3>Licensing</h3>
			<p>A licence could be of benefit to a small business looking for a short-term property solution, of up to one year. Licences generally offer more flexibility and can usually be terminated at short notice on both sides. However, you would not have an automatic right to renew a licence and it is always advisable to seek professional advice, eg from a chartered surveyor or solicitor.</p>
