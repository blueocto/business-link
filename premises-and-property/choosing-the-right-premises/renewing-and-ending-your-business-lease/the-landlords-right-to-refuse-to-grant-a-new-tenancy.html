			<h1>Renewing and ending your business lease</h1>
			<h2>The landlord's right to refuse to grant a new tenancy</h2>
			<p>Although business tenants generally have the right to renew the tenancy of their premises when it comes to an end, landlords can refuse to grant a new tenancy in some cases.</p>
			<p>The landlord can refuse to renew:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the tenant does not have the right to renew, see the page in this guide on <a href="detaildfb9.html?itemId=1084384259&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="Which tenants have the right to renew their business lease, and which don't, under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954">which tenants have the right to renew their business lease?</a></li>
				<li>If the tenant is in breach of their obligations. See the page in this guide on <a href="/premises-and-property/choosing-the-right-premises/renewing-and-ending-your-business-lease/paying-rent-and-rent-reviews.php" title="Rental agreements between tenants and landlords and an outline of what rent reviews are">paying rent and rent reviews</a>.</li>
				<li>If the landlord is offering to provide other suitable accommodation for the tenant.</li>
				<li>Where a sub-tenant occupying part of the premises applies for a new lease, but the landlord wants to let or sell the premises as a whole.</li>
				<li>Where the landlord wishes to demolish or reconstruct the premises. However, the tenant could remain in occupation if they allow the landlord access to carry out reconstruction work or accept a new tenancy for part of the premises.</li>
				<li>Where the landlord wishes to use the premises themselves, for their business, or to live there.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Landlords wishing to oppose renewal on these grounds will need to serve a 'section 25 notice' setting out their grounds for refusing a new tenancy. This will bring the tenancy to an end on the date specified in the notice, unless the tenant applies to the court to challenge the landlord's grounds of opposition. If the court upholds the landlord's grounds for refusing a new tenancy, the tenant will need to leave the premises, normally within three months. If the court agrees with the tenant's challenge, it will order the grant of a new tenancy and settle its terms.</p>
			<p>If the landlord and tenant have not agreed on the terms of a new tenancy, and neither party has applied to court and the parties have not entered into a written agreement to extend the deadline for applying to court, the tenancy will end on the date specified in the landlord's notice of termination or the tenant's request for a new tenancy. The landlord would then have no obligation to offer a new tenancy, even if the notice of termination said that he or she was not opposed to granting one.</p>
