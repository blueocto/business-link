			<h1>Renting business premises</h1>
			<h2>Alterations to the property</h2>
			<p><strong>Planning permission</strong> is not always required if you wish to make alterations to the property - for example if you want to make changes to the inside of the building or minor alterations to the outside. Also, a specific application is not needed if you want to put up low walls or fences, although you should always check whether building regulations are required by contacting the building control section at your local authority.</p>
			<p>However, planning permission is generally required if you want to extend, convert or change the external nature of the premises. It is always a good idea to check with your local planning authority whether the development will require planning permission at the proposal stage. The majority of significant building work also has to conform to building regulations. See our guides: <a href="layer4ec1.html?topicId=1086492221" title="How the planning system works, how to apply for planning permission and how to appeal against a decision">an overview of the planning system</a> and <a href="layer00dd.html?topicId=1086459335" title="An overview of building regulations and how they control building work">building regulations - an overview</a>.</p>
			<p>Before you start any alteration work, you should check the details of the lease. You may need to get permission from the landlord. Unless the lease expressly prohibits improvements, the landlord may not unreasonably withhold consent to tenants' improvements. Also, you should clarify whether you will be required to <strong>reinstate the property</strong> to its original condition before the agreement expires.</p>
			<p>If you change the number of units that the property is divided into (for example dividing one shop unit into two or merging two into one), which include fixed services for heating, hot water, air conditioning or mechanical ventilation, an Energy Performance Certificate will be required when the work is completed. It is the responsibility of the person carrying out the building work to provide the certificate.</p>
			<p>See our guide on <a href="layer67a8.html?topicId=1082081368" title="When Energy Performance Certificates are needed and who commissions and produces them for business properties">Energy Performance Certificates - business properties</a>.</p>
			<p>Before any alterations are made you should consider whether asbestos might be present. <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/campaign/duty.htm#comply" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk">Read about managing asbestos on the Health &amp; Safety Executive website</a>.</p>
			<p>You should also check whether the works you are planning will alter your rateable value. The rateable value of business premises is based on their open market rental value. Changing your premises may affect this. See our guide on <a href="layerc19b.html?topicId=1080387124" title="How changing your premises or the business you use them for can affect your business rates">changing your premises and business rates</a>.</p>
			<p>You also need to be aware of liability for <strong>repairs</strong>. If you rent workspace in multi-occupancy premises, liability for external repairs and maintaining common areas is likely to fall with the landlord. Check the terms of the lease to find out who is responsible.</p>
			<p>You should also check the rental agreement to see whether there is any repair work pending. You may decide to commission a survey and ensure that any such work is finished before the rental agreement is signed in order to avoid paying the bill.</p>
