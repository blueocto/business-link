			<h1>Commercial property: responsibilities of business tenants</h1>
			<h2>Ensuring gas safety</h2>
			<p>Occupiers - whether employers or self-employed people - must ensure that any gas appliance, installation pipework or flue installed in their workplace is maintained in a safe condition.</p>
			<p>You must maintain such equipment according to the manufacturer's instructions, which will often mean that an annual service by a <strong>Gas Safe registered engineer</strong> is required.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Registration requirements for gas engineers and information for consumers">Search for a Gas Safe registered engineer on the Gas Safe Register website</a>.</p>
			<p>Your lease or a separate contractual agreement can help to set out practical arrangements for ensuring gas safety requirements are met. However, the ultimate legal responsibility remains with the occupier of the workplace concerned.</p>
			<p>The owner, or other person in control of the building, may also have duties under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 - such as ensuring <b>heating equipment</b> in common parts is maintained safely. The lease or separate contractual agreement can be used to determine how these responsibilities are allocated.</p>
			<p>More information on the duties of employers and self-employed people on gas safety is available from the Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE). You can <a href="http://www.hsebooks.com/Books/product/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=HSEBooks&amp;category%5Fname=&amp;product%5Fid=3159" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Covers the safe installation, maintenance and use of gas systems, including gas fittings, appliances and flues">buy the guide on safety in the installation and use of gas systems and appliances on the HSE Books website</a> or you can call the HSE Books Enquiry Line on Tel 01787 881165.</p>
