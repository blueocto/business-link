			<h1>Use your home as a workplace</h1>
			<h2>What to check before starting a work at home business</h2>
			<p>Depending on the nature of your business, you may need to check with some of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>your mortgage lender or landlord/freeholder - further information about using your home to run a business may be contained in your mortgage or tenancy agreement</li>
				<li>your insurance provider, to see if you need to take out extra insurance</li>
				<li>the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), to see if you will be charged business rates - see our guide: <a href="layer444c.html?topicId=1086066107" title="What business rates are used for and the meanings of key words and phrases">business rates - an overview</a></li>
				<li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs and an accountant, to see what your income, VAT and Capital Gains Tax position is</li>
				<li>a solicitor, to check legal aspects</li>
				<li>the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) or your local authority, to find out the health and safety aspects of running a work at home business</li>
				<li>your neighbours, to make sure they have no objection to you running your business from home</li>
				<li>the planning and building control department of your local authority, to see if you need planning permission or to comply with building regulations - see the page in this guide on <a href="/premises-and-property/choosing-the-right-premises/use-your-home-as-a-workplace.php" title="Building and planning considerations when working from home">building regulations and planning permission for home businesses</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Plan for emergencies</h3>
			<p>Working from home is not generally considered a high-risk area for emergencies. However, you should take precautions in case there is a <strong>fire</strong> in the home. You should have:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>an adequate warning system - put up a domestic <strong>smoke alarm</strong> in your work area and check it regularly</li>
				<li>a way of escape - work this out in advance</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You could also consider buying a domestic fire extinguisher or fire blanket and keeping a small <strong>first-aid</strong> kit in your home office.</p>
