			<h1>Use your home as a workplace</h1>
			<h2>Work equipment and workstation setup</h2>
			<p>Make sure that your work equipment is safe and that other members of your household, especially small children, can't be harmed by it.</p>
			<p>Electrical safety is extremely important and the equipment you use must be fit for the job and checked regularly. Make sure you don't overload socket points.</p>
			<h3>Setting up the work area</h3>
			<p>There are many things to consider when setting up your work area, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>equipment must meet basic standards and be properly set up</li>
				<li>chairs should be adjustable to suit any user</li>
				<li>computer equipment should be safe and not affect the user's health</li>
				<li>computer screens should be free from glare and reflections</li>
				<li>workstations must be adjusted to a comfortable position, with the keyboard in the correct position</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Security</h3>
			<p>When working from home, you have to be careful about the security of work equipment and data, particularly if it is sensitive. You should consider the following carefully:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Is your home generally secured against theft? It may be a good idea to ask a crime prevention officer to look around your home and give advice on how you can make it more secure.</li>
				<li>Have you considered how you will protect your work from other occupants of your home? If you have to share a computer make sure you back up your work regularly and that your work is password protected.</li>
				<li>Do you have adequate insurance? Remember that your general household insurance is unlikely to cover expensive business equipment.</li>
				<li>Do you have a lockable filing cabinet or safe? It may be wise to purchase a fireproof safe for irreplaceable items.</li>
				<li>Can you dispose of sensitive information in a secure way? For example sensitive papers should be carefully shredded (preferably using a cross-cut shredder), and not simply disposed of with the household rubbish.</li>
				<li>Do you ever transport your equipment or work in public places such as on a train? Equipment should never be left unattended or unsecured in a public place. Also, you should be careful about what is displayed on your screen when it can be seen by unauthorised people.</li>
