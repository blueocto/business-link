			<h2>Tax considerations of working from home</h2>
			<p>Working from home can affect your tax situation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your business will be able to claim<strong> tax relief</strong> on domestic bills for the areas of the house used for your business.</li>
				<li>If your business is <strong>VAT registered</strong>, you may be able to claim back VAT on articles you buy for business use.</li>
				<li>If you have set aside a room solely for working in, you'll have to work out if there's Capital Gains Tax to pay if you sell your house. <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cgt/property/sell-own-home.htm" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Information about paying Capital Gains Tax if you work from home">Find out about Capital Gains Tax relief on your home on the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) website</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>From 1 April 2011 for the purposes of Corporation Tax, and 6 April 2011 for income tax furnished holiday properties let on a commercial basis can qualify for tax treatment under the Furnished Holiday Lettings (FHL) rules. To qualify properties must be in the UK or European Economic Area and be available for commercial letting to the public for a minimum period. <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/budget2010/fhl-qa-3755.pdf" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="FAQs on the changes to the furnished holiday lettings rules">Download frequently asked questions on the FHL rules from the HMRC website (PDF, 55K)</a>.</p>
			<p>Always consult an accountant or HMRC on taxation issues.

			<h3>Paying business rates</h3>
			<p>Business rates instead of council tax may be payable on domestic premises that are used for business purposes - for example if you work from home, provide bed-and-breakfast or let your house as a holiday home. See our guide: <a href="layer444c.html?topicId=1086066107" title="What business rates are used for and the meanings of key words and phrases">business rates - an overview</a>.</p>
			<p>Contact your local authority and the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) for more information. You can <a href="http://www.voa.gov.uk/corporate/_downloads/pdf/workingFromHome.pdf" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Information about the rates you should pay if you use your home for business purposes">download the factsheet on working from home from the VOA website (PDF, 179K)</a>.</p>
