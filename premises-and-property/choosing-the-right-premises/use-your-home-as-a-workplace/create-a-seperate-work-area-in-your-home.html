			<h1>Use your home as a workplace</h1>
			<h2>Create a seperate work area in your home</h2>
			<p>The area of your home that you use for work should ideally be completely separate from the rest of your home. It helps if you can avoid being disturbed when you are working. You also want to be able to relax during your time off without being interrupted by work. A spare room with a door that locks or an outbuilding such as a garage or shed is best, so that:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the risk of accidental damage to your work or equipment will be reduced</li>
				<li>it will help you 'shut off' from home life, so that you can deal with your clients in a professional manner</li>
				<li>your work equipment won't be a risk to members of your household</li>
				<li>it will be easier to resist demands from other members of your household</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Allocating part of your house as a workplace can have <b>tax</b> and <b>insurance</b> implications. See the page in this guide on the <a href="detailb04d.html?itemId=1073791628&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="The tax implications of working from home including VAT, Capital Gains Tax, council tax and business rates">tax considerations of working from home</a>.</p>
			<p>If complete segregation of work from home is not possible then <b>partial segregation</b> is the next best option. You could:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>use your office equipment in a general area of the house such as a sitting or dining room</li>
				<li>lock away equipment and work when it is not in use</li>
				<li>consider housing your workstation in a cupboard with lockable shutters or doors</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Remember to be very careful about safety and to consider the effects on other members of your household.</p>
			<p>It is a good idea to have a separate telephone line and answering machine for your business calls.</p>
