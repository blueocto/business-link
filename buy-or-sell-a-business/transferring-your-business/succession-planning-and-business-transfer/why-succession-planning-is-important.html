            <h1>Succession planning and business transfer</h1>
            <h2>Why succession planning is important</h2>
            <p>Some 65 per cent of private firms in the UK are family owned. However, fewer than half of first-generation family businesses have succession plans.</p>
            <p>Common reasons include <strong>resistance by the owner</strong> to let go of the reins, fear of retirement or inability to find or choose an effective successor.</p>
            <p>Transferring ownership can be highly emotional and complicated, which is why often it is <strong>ignored until it becomes a pressing issue</strong>, for example, when the owner becomes ill or too old to carry on running the business.</p>
            <p>Often, business owners are busy dealing with day-to-day issues and consequently end up failing to attach enough importance to planning succession.</p>
            <h3>What is at stake</h3>
            <p>Leaving succession planning until the last minute is likely to mean effective transferral of ownership is not possible within the necessary time frame. A <strong>forced, ill-informed or panic decision</strong> could mean the business is transferred into reluctant or unqualified hands.</p>
            <p>The business could be severely disrupted as conflicts take place over who should own or run the business, while uncertainty and lack of leadership could have a disastrous effect on sales and morale within the business.</p>
            <p>All of the above could ultimately result in the failure of the business. Setting aside sufficient time to think and formulate an effective succession plan is an important <strong>key to success</strong>.</p>
            <h3>The benefits of getting it right</h3>
            <p>An effective succession plan should form part of your<strong> overall business development strategy</strong>.</p>
            <p>Knowing exactly how, when and to whom ownership will be transferred is the most likely way to maximise your returns.</p>
            <p>Choosing the right successor and the right time to transfer the business is the best way to ensure the ongoing success of the business.</p>
