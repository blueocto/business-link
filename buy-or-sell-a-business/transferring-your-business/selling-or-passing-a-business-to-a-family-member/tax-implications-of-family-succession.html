    <h1>Selling or passing a business to a family member</h1>
    <h2>Tax implications of family succession</h2>
    <p>Think carefully about the tax implications of family succession. There have been significant reforms to the way Capital Gains Tax is calculated that could affect your succession planning.</p>
    <p>The reforms included the withdrawal of the indexation allowance and the introduction of 'entrepreneurs' relief'.</p>
    <p>Entrepreneurs can claim relief on gains made on the disposal of all or part of a business, or a disposal of a business' asset after a business has ceased. The relief gives an effective rate of 10 per cent on all gains up to &pound;5 million (the limit for gains before 6 April 2010 was &pound;1 million, and was &pound;2 million between 6 April 2010 and 23 June 2010). Claims can be made on more than one occasion up to the &pound;5 million lifetime limit. To qualify for entrepreneur's relief you will need a minimum 5 per cent stake in the company and either work, or be on the board, of the business and to have held the shares for more than a year.</p>
    <p>Gains over the lifetime limit are charged at the new higher rate of Capital Gains Tax of 28 per cent.</p>
    <p>Entrepreneurs that made a qualifying claim above the previous &pound;1 million limit before 6 April 2010 will not receive relief on the excess above the previous limit. However, if they make further qualifying claims after 5 April 2010 they will be able to claim relief on additional gains up to the new limit.</p>
    <p>See our guide on <a href="layera0b8.html?topicId=1084229250" title="Entrepreneurs' Relief, Business Roll-Over Relief, Business Transfer Relief, Gifts Hold-Over Relief">Capital Gains Tax reliefs for business assets</a>.</p>
    <p>You may qualify for business-property relief from inheritance tax if you sell or pass to relatives:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>your business</li>
        <li>an interest in your business - your share of a partnership, for example</li>
        <li>shares in your limited company</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This should allow you to make such transfers free of inheritance tax for at least two years, even if you don't live for seven years from the transfer date.</p>
    <p>You can <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cto/customerguide/page16.htm" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Guidance on claiming business relief on transfers of certain types of business and of business assets">find out about inheritance tax reliefs for businesses on the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) website</a>.</p>
    <p>If you dispose of your business to a relative, other than your spouse or civil partner, you may have to pay Capital Gains Tax on any gains made on these 'assets'. Note that the open market value of the assets of the business may be used in calculating the taxable gains if the disposal of an asset is for less than this value, or for something that cannot be valued.</p>
    <p>You may be able to defer (hold over) Capital Gains Tax, meaning your successor will pay it if and when the gain is released in the future.</p>
