            <h1>Selling or passing a business to a family member</h1>
            <h2>One family successor or more?</h2>
            <p>The best way to hand your business over to your family is to nominate a <strong>single</strong> successor from among your offspring or other relatives involved in the business. This isn't always practical or realistic, however.</p>
            <p>In making your decision you must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>determine objectively who can best take your business forward</li>
                <li>aim to reduce the potential for future conflict</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Successful communication with all family members is crucial to making any decisions. <a href="http://static.staging.bdo.defacto-cms.com/assets/documents/2010/04/Family_business_rulebook.pdf" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Guide for family businesses on the importance of reconciling the short and long-term needs of a business with those of the family">Download a copy of the guide on getting the family to work together from the BDO Stoy Hayward website (PDF, 55K)</a>.</p>
            <p>Remember that there are other ways of being <strong>financially fair</strong> to your offspring or other relatives without involving them all in the future management of the business.</p>
            <p>For example, you could take out a <strong>life insurance policy</strong> for those who won't benefit from inheriting the business. Or you could split your business' <strong>shares</strong> into two classes - giving full voting rights to your successor and restricted or non-voting rights to family members with no managerial involvement.</p>
            <p>If nominating more than one successor is your chosen option you should ensure the co-successors have a similar vision of the business' future and a similar commitment to it. To limit the potential for conflict - which could even lead to the break-up of the business - it can help if you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>determine separate areas of responsibility for each successor</li>
                <li>put in place formal dispute-resolution procedures</li>
                <li>appoint an independent board of directors</li>
