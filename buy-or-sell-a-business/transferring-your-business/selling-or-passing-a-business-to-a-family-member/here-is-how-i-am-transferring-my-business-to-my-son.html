    <h1>Here's how I'm transferring my business to my son</h1>
    <h2>Here's how I'm transferring my business to my son</h2>
    <p>Nick Robey founded Lincolnshire-based Systematic Print Management Ltd in 1975. He has developed it into a thriving small business turning over more than &pound;3 million and employing 20 people. Now though, he is gradually stepping back from the company as he hands over control to his son, managing director Chris.</p>
    <p><strong>What I did</strong></p>
    <h3>Make no assumptions about family succession</h3>
    <p>"It was important that when my children were growing up there was no assumption about a job lined up for them.</p>
    <p>"I did think about what would happen later - would I sell the business, close it, put a manager in to run it&hellip; But we never talked much about the business at home and certainly never said, 'One day you can work with Dad'.</p>
    <p>"It's really important that children choose their own careers. First, so they're not forced into or just drift into the business, and second, if they do eventually come into it they bring something with them. Chris is a qualified solicitor and practised for six years before he decided to join us.</p>
    <p>"My other two children have expressed no wish whatsoever to join the business."</p>
    <h3>Ensure Chris started from the bottom</h3>
    <p>"If Chris had joined us when he was 18 I'd have had him sweeping the warehouse but he was about 30 and well qualified so we put him into a sales team as sales support. That way he got to know the business bottom-up from a trading point of view. Soon after he decided he wanted a sales role too and so he went out canvassing. Within a short time he was proving himself in the area critical to us - getting new orders.</p>
    <p>"I presented Chris coming into the company as a solution rather than a problem. I said to staff, 'This is our plan for succession'. It hasn't been a problem to keep other senior staff motivated on that basis - I sold it as a positive move. With a family business, everyone knows that if there's no succession, the business will either close or change ownership. Bringing Chris into the business in the way we did showed the family's long-term commitment to the business, offering continuity and certainty."</p>
    <h3>Put in place provision for my other heirs</h3>
    <p>"After Chris came to join us inheritance was a concern. It prompted us to turn the business from a partnership into a limited company. We created 30,000 shares, 10,000 of which are voting shares and 20,000 non-voting. At the moment my wife and I own them all but the idea is that when we die Chris will be left with the voting shares and my other two children are left with half each of the non-voting shares."</p>
    <p><strong>What I'd do differently</strong></p>
    <h3>Withdraw from day-to-day business activities sooner</h3>
    <p>"There have been occasions when I've been hovering around and in danger of undermining Chris. Just occasionally I might have said to someone, for example, 'Why have you used black, wouldn't blue have been better?' and my son has had to say, 'Well, we talked about it yesterday and decided on black.' You can have a laugh about it but it is a bit embarrassing. You have to accept that other people - even your son - will do things differently from you."</p>
