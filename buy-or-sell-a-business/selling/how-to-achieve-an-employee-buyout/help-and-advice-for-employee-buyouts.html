    <h1>How to achieve an employee buyout</h1>
    <h2>Help and advice for employee buyouts</h2>
    <p>There are several organisations that provide help and support for employee buyouts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Employer Ownership Association (EOA), the association of employee-owned and trust-owned businesses, offers information and advice. <a href="http://www.employeeownership.co.uk/about.htm" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Information about co-ownership of businesses">Find out about employee ownership on the EOA website</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Baxi Partnership helps fund and structure employee buyouts. <a href="http://www.baxipartnership.co.uk/" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Information to help fund and structure employee buyouts">Funding and support on the Baxi Partnership website</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Co-operative and Community Finance offers loans for employee-owned businesses. <a href="http://www.icof.co.uk/index.php?content=borrow" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Information about borrowing from Co-operative & Community Finance">Find out about financing on the Co-operative and Community Finance website</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Co-operatives UK can put you in touch with member development bodies offering hands-on advice and support. <a href="http://www.cooperatives-uk.coop/" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Details about developing and extending the co-operative sector">Find out about Co-operatives UK on the Co-operatives UK website</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your localBusiness Link can also provide advice and put you in touch with local support services.</p>
    <p>In addition, both the business owner and employees will need professional advisers such as lawyers and accountants to help negotiate the buyout. If an employee trust is being set up, the trustees also need advice. If you can, it makes sense to get advice from specialists with prior experience of employee buyouts.</p>
    <p><a href="http://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find a solicitor with buyout experience on the Law Society website</a>.</p>

    <p>Owner, employees and trustees all need independent advice as their interests are not necessarily the same.</p>
