    <h1>Obtaining information on a business you are thinking of buying</h1>
    <h2>Legal and financial checks</h2>
    <p>When considering buying a business, ask the vendors for any information you wish to see. They should be happy to provide this, although you may have to sign a confidentiality agreement. The seller will want to protect certain aspects of the business, so some information may be off limits until close to completion - despite your signing of a confidentiality agreement.</p>
    <p>The legal and financial things to check and where to get help with these include:</p>
    <h3>Information about the business</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Check the vendor has the legal right to sell the business as there may be more than one decision-maker involved. If the business is a company registered at Companies House you will be able to get the necessary information from Companies House.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The original business plan</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask to see the original business plan. This will outline issues such as start-up finance which may notify you of any outstanding loans, for example.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Financial commitments</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask to see the business' accounts, including the detailed management profit and loss account and balance sheet. These and other documents may be available from Companies House if the business is legally formed as a company.</li>
        <li>Ask for documentation regarding outstanding loans and debts. Get your accountant to look at any financial details.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ownership of assets</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Check the business has legal ownership of its key assets and what the terms are. Ask your solicitor to check the property deeds for premises owned by the business, for example, or ask for the rental agreement and speak to the landlord if you want to run the business from its current premises.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Legal actions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Check with the Registry Trust for any court cases or late-payment actions being taken against or by the business that could affect its finances or reputation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the company is registered at Companies House, you can obtain copies of the company accounts, the annual return and the other key documents filed by your target business using the Companies House WebCHeck service. The documents can be downloaded from the Companies House website, some at a small fee, helping you assess the value of the business and its assets. <a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/toolsToHelp/WCInfo.shtml" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="detailed information on who you're doing business with at the Companies House website">Read information on the Companies House WebCHeck service on the Companies House website</a>.</p>
    <p>You should also ask for information and documentation regarding the business' current employees, IT and other technology and issues relating to the environment.</p>
    <p>It is sensible to take advice from professionals with experience of valuing businesses and their assets, such as accountants, lawyers, chartered surveyors, business transfer agents, business brokers and corporate financiers.</p>
