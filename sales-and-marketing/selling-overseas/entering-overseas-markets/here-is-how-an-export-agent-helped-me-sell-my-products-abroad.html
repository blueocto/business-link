        <h1>Here's how an export agent helped me sell my products abroad</h1>
        <h2>Here's how an export agent helped me sell my products abroad</h2>
        <p>Managing director Martin Statter wanted to develop overseas markets for Graphskill Limited's specialist pipework components, but did not have the time or resources to risk setting up offices overseas. Engaging an agent has helped develop overseas trade at the right pace for the business. Here Martin explains how he did it.</p>
        <p><strong>What we did</strong></p>
        <h3>Use a trade visit</h3>
        <p>"We had been thinking about export markets for some time. While we had sold overseas as subcontractors on large orders, we thought there would be some benefit in establishing a local presence in key markets. We went on a trade mission to Germany organised by UK Trade &amp; Investment and met with a number of potential agents."</p>
        <h3>Find an agent we could trust</h3>
        <p>"We found an agent who was looking to add a company like ours to his portfolio. During the meeting, we didn't overplay our mutual expectations and we felt we could trust each other. As soon as we got home, he had confirmed in writing the framework that we had tentatively agreed on and we converted that into a co-operation agreement. There were clearly defined timescales and responsibilities in the co-operation agreement and it suited both parties."</p>
        <h3>Manage the relationship</h3>
        <p>"We keep in touch regularly with our agent. If there hasn't been any activity for a while, we check in just to see what's happening in the market. Email is very useful from that point of view, but we usually speak on the phone if we need to be absolutely clear about the detail of an order.</p>
        <p>"Differences in language can play a big part, especially when you're involved in a business that uses lots of terminology like ours. We realised this when we translated some promotional material into German for our agent. He picked out a couple of phrases that could have been easily misunderstood in translation. It's regular contact that helps minimise the risk of any confusion like that."</p>
        <p><strong>What I'd do differently</strong></p>
        <h3>Develop our website before looking at overseas markets</h3>
        <p>"We've revamped our website using specialist designers and it has made a huge difference. Potential overseas customers will often want to check your company out before even talking to an agent about your products, so it's an essential shop window."</p>

                        <li>
                            "Make sure you are comfortable with your agent on a personal level - they will represent your business overseas, so you will need to have a personal empathy with them."
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            "Check the agent's portfolio and follow up references - you need to be sure they are capable of doing what they say they are and that they will be comfortable selling your product alongside others they represent."
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            "Formalise the agreement - at the very least you need to have agreed commission rates, length of agreement and mutual responsibilities set down in writing. It's also a good idea for the first agreement to cover a relatively short time period in case it doesn't work out for either party."
                        </li>
