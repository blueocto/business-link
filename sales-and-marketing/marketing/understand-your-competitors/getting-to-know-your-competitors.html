			<h1>Understand your competitors</h1>
			<h2>Getting to know your competitors</h2>
			<p>Speak to your competitors. Phone them to ask for a copy of their <b>brochure</b> or get one of your staff or a friend to pick up their marketing literature.</p>
			<p>You could ask for a <b>price list</b> or enquire what an off-the-shelf item might cost and if there's a discount for volume. This will give you an idea at which point a competitor will discount and at what volume.</p>
			<p>Phone and face-to-face contacts will also give you an idea of the <b>style</b> of the company, the quality of their literature and the initial impressions they make on customers.</p>
			<p>It's also likely you'll meet competitors at social and business events. Talk to them. Be <b>friendly</b> - they're competitors not enemies. You'll probably share common problems. You'll get a better idea of them - and you might need each other one day, for example in collaborating to grow a new market for a new product.</p>
			<p>At the same time, make sure that you do not behave in an anti-competitive fashion. Fixing prices or agreeing not to compete is illegal. This includes activities with a price-fixing effect, such as discussing your pricing plans with competitors.</p>
			<p>See our guide on <a href="layerbe30.html?topicId=1074014670" title="How to ensure your business complies with competition law and is not a victim of anti-competitive practices">competing fairly</a>.</p>
			<h3>Listen to your customers and suppliers</h3>
			<p>Make the most of contacts with your customers. Ask which of your competitors they buy from and how you <b>compare</b>. Use your judgement with any information they volunteer. For instance, when customers say your prices are higher than the competition they may just be trying to negotiate a better deal.</p>
			<p>Use meetings with your <b>suppliers</b> to ask what their other customers are doing. They may not tell you everything you want to know, but they may have something useful to say.</p>
