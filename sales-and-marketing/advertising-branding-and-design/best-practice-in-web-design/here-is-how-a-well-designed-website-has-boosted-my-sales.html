    <h1>Here's how a well-designed website has boosted my sales </h1>
    <h2>Here's how a well-designed website has boosted my sales </h2>
    <p>Maidstone-based company How2Become was set up in 2005 to provide career guidance through CD-Roms, DVDs, books and training courses. The firm's managing director, Richard McMunn, designed the business' first website, but that has now been replaced by a professionally-designed site that has helped double his sales. Richard explains what was done.</p>
    <h3>What I did</h3>
    <br>
    <p>"I started How2Become because I work for the fire service and people used to come and ask questions about how to join so I wrote a CD giving insider tips. It started with that and snowballed from there.</p>
    <p>"I knew I needed a website straight away to sell the product. My first attempt was appalling, but I was learning as I went. It was basically a picture of a CD and a picture of a firefighter. It took about three months to sell anything and a lot of that was because of my website. I've got it right now but I invested heavily - financially and time-wise - to achieve that."</p>
    <h4>Bring in the professionals</h4>
    <p>"The site I designed was turning over about &pound;300,000 a year, but I knew it could be better. I wanted to create a brand to get people coming back and recommending the site to others, so I found a great design agency to help."</p>
    <h4>Keep it simple</h4>
    <p>"The business is now on track for about &pound;600,000 a year, which is mainly down to the website and also the products. I love the site now because it looks fantastic and is very simple, which is key. Everything is accessible from the home page and there is not much text. It says 'Do you want to join the police?', for example, and it says it with images, too, because we all like images better than text."</p>
    <h4>Ensure the technical side is fit for purpose</h4>
    <p>"At first I wasn't aware of the technical side of things and I got caught out with that. Things like the server size are important - my website kept crashing because there were too many people on it. Now it's not extremely fast, but it's fast enough."</p>
    <h4>Make your site user friendly</h4>
    <p>"When someone goes onto a website you have eight seconds on average to catch their attention. If everything takes too long to find - or too long to load - they will go elsewhere.</p>
    <p>"I put a lot of time, effort and money in to get it right but, at the end of the day, my website is my shop. If I had a shop on the high street, then I would want it to look just as good."</p>
    <h3>What I'd do differently</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Leave more white space</h4>
    <p>"The site is very colourful and busy, and with hindsight I might have had more white space. One of the most, if not the most, used websites in the world is Google and it is just one picture and a search box."</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>"Make your site about the customer, not you. Customers are not generally interested in masses of detail about your company."</li>
                    <li>"Persevere until you get it right. If it doesn't work the first time don't give up, keep going."</li>
                    <li>"Keep image file sizes small so they load quickly. You have eight seconds on average to catch someone's attention so it is important that your website loads quickly."</li>
