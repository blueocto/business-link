    <h1>Mergers</h1>
    <h2>Merger assessment and decisions</h2>
    <p>In broad terms, there are two types of merger:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>horizontal mergers</strong> - mergers between firms that supply competing products</li>
        <li><strong>non-horizontal mergers</strong> - mergers between firms that operate at different levels of the supply chain (vertical mergers) or between firms supplying products at the same level in the supply chain which do not compete (conglomerate mergers)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In looking at horizontal mergers, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) focuses mainly on the impact of the merger on the markets in which both firms operate.</p>
    <p>In non-horizontal mergers, the OFT looks at the impact of the merger on the markets in which each of the companies operate, as well as any related markets.</p>
    <p>The OFT also takes into account:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the definition of the market(s) that the parties operate in</li>
        <li>market share and concentration</li>
        <li>efficiencies</li>
        <li>entry and expansion</li>
        <li>buyer power</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Decisions</h3>
    <p>When the OFT makes a decision on a merger, it will fall into one of four categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The merger is not a relevant merger situation.</li>
        <li>The merger is not being referred to the Competition Commission (CC), either because the merger does not raise any competition concerns or one of the exceptions applies - see the page in this guide on <a href="detail198b.html?itemId=1086778061&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="The roles of the Office of Fair Trading, Competition Commission and Secretary of State under the Enterprise Act">who is responsible for UK merger control?</a> </li>
        <li>Undertakings in lieu of a reference are being considered or have been accepted by the OFT - see the page in this guide <a href="detail198b.html?itemId=1086778061&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="The roles of the Office of Fair Trading, Competition Commission and Secretary of State under the Enterprise Act">on who is responsible for UK merger control?</a> </li>
        <li>The merger is being referred to the CC.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The OFT will contact the parties involved one hour before the decision is announced publically, and will tell them the timing and nature of the decision. In those cases where a press release is issued, this will be sent to the parties at the same time.</p>
    <h3>Undertakings in lieu of reference</h3>
    <p>Where the OFT has decided that a merger should be referred to the CC, it may instead accept undertakings from the merging companies in order to resolve the potential concerns of the merger. For more information, see the page in this guide <a href="detail198b.html?itemId=1086778061&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="The roles of the Office of Fair Trading, Competition Commission and Secretary of State under the Enterprise Act">on who is responsible for UK merger control?</a></p>
    <p>In public interest cases the Secretary of State will make the decision on the case and will consider whether undertakings in lieu of reference are acceptable.</p>
