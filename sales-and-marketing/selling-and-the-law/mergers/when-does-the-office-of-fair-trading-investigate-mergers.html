            <h1>Mergers</h1>
            <h2>When does the Office of Fair Trading investigate mergers?</h2>
            <p>When you decide to merge businesses, through takeover, acquisition or a joint venture, you may be reducing competition in your field. If your merger will substantially lessen competition it may be prohibited or you may have conditions imposed upon you.</p>
            <p>The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) is responsible for investigating mergers and referring cases to the Competition Commission for an in-depth inquiry if they believe the merger may be expected to result in a <strong>substantial lessening</strong> of competition.</p>
            <h3>Relevant merger situations</h3>
            <p>The OFT only has jurisdiction over 'relevant merger situations' - mergers that meet <strong>all three</strong> criteria. To qualify, OFT requires that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Two or more enterprises (a business or part of a business) are brought together by the merger.</li>
                <li>The merger must not have taken place yet, or taken place not longer than four months ago.</li>
                <li><strong>Either</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The business being taken over has a turnover in the UK of at least &pound;70 million</li>
                        <li>The combined businesses have significant market presence. This applies if together they supply (or acquire) at least 25 per cent of particular goods or services in the UK (or a substantial part of the UK), and the merger results in an increase in the share of supply or consumption of such goods or services.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because of this last criterion, many mergers between smaller businesses are unlikely to qualify for investigation.</p>
            <p>If you are involved in a merger which does meet these criteria, you may need to seek advice.</p>
