            <p>There are various reasons why businesses join together and voluntarily regulate their own behaviour, through self-regulation. For example, self-regulatory initiatives are often run by a trade body who ensures its members achieve compliance with consumer law or commits to go beyond what the law requires.</p>
            <p>Self-regulation usually involves creating a set of rules, such as a code of practice, voluntary standards or accreditation. Self-regulation can also include arrangements for the provision of industry guidance material and for action to address particular compliance problems.</p>
            <p>There are several code of practice schemes which are run or endorsed by Government, such as the Office of Fair Trading's (OFT's) Consumer Codes Approval Scheme - or Approved Code Scheme - TrustMark.</p>
            <p>This guide explains the benefits of self-regulation and codes schemes in consumer protection. You will also find information on how your business can get involved with self-regulation and join an approved scheme.</p>
