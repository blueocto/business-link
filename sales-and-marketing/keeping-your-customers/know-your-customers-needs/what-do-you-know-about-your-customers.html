            <h1>Know your customers' needs</h1>
            <h2>What do you know about your customers?</h2>
            <p>The more you know about your customers, the more effective your sales and marketing efforts will be. Find out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>who</b> they are - including individuals in other businesses who are responsible for the decision to buy from you</li>
                <li><b>what</b> they buy</li>
                <li><b>why</b> they buy it</li>
                <li><strong>how</strong> they use your product</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For information on targeting decision-makers, see our guide on <a href="/sales-and-marketing/selling/the-sales-process.php" title="How to follow a step-by-step process to achieve sales, and build long-term customer relationships">the sales process</a>.</p>
            <p>You can learn a great deal about your customers by <b>talking</b> to them. Ask them why they're buying, what they may want to buy and what other needs they have. This could highlight valuable developments you can make to your current offering. See our guides on <a href="layerad08.html?topicId=1081822412" title="How businesses can compete and carve out a share of a marketplace dominated by bigger names">spotting market opportunities</a> and how to <a href="/starting-up/considering-starting-up/research-and-develop-your-business-ideas-new-products-and-services.php" title="How to develop your idea into a viable business by investing in new products or services to meet customer needs">research and develop your business ideas, new products and services</a>.</p>
            <p>It's also worth keeping an eye on <b>future developments</b> in your customers' markets and lives. Knowing the <b>trends</b> that are going to influence your customer helps you to <b>anticipate</b> what they will need. Market research can help you build a picture of where your customers' business - and your own - may be going.
