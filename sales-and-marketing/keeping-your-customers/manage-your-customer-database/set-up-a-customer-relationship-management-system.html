			<h1>Manage your customer database</h1>
			<h2>Set up a customer relationship management system</h2>
			<p>There are a number of practical issues to consider when introducing a marketing database as part of your customer relationship management (CRM) system. You will need to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>estimate the likely scale of the system</li>
				<li>balance your requirements against your budget</li>
				<li>consider integration with other business systems</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Depending on your practical needs, you can choose between various ways of setting up a <strong>computer-based marketing database</strong>.</p>
			<h3>Create your own system</h3>
			<p>The least expensive option is to create a simple system of recording data (such as invoices, sales records for existing customers, and customer contact lists) in a single spreadsheet. You can then regularly update your customer contact records. For more information, see the page in this guide on <a href="/sales-and-marketing/keeping-your-customers/manage-your-customer-database/compiling-your-customer-data.php" title="Building your database and considering what information you need to keep">compiling your customer data</a>.</p>
			<h3>Using a software supplier</h3>
			<p>If you want to do more with your customer sales and marketing data, you could buy a <strong>basic software package</strong> and create an office-wide database that all your staff can use.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, you could buy a <strong>dedicated CRM package</strong> such as Oracle, SAP, Peoplesoft, Microsoft, Onyx and Pivotal. However, CRM packages generally require servers, staff training, and customisation so setting them up can be quite complicated.</p>
			<p>For more information, see the page in this guide on <a href="/sales-and-marketing/keeping-your-customers/manage-your-customer-database/how-to-choose-a-supplier-for-your-customer-database-system.php" title="Criteria for selecting a supplier and what to consider, such as costs per licence">how to choose a supplier for your customer database system</a>.</p>
			<p>You could commission <strong>bespoke software</strong> and integrate it with your existing software and your website. This can be expensive and may be more appropriate for larger and more complex businesses.</p>
			<p>Or you could opt for a<strong> managed CRM solution</strong> such as Software as a Service (SaaS), where you use software that is hosted externally by an application service provider (ASP) - known as 'cloud computing'. For more information about the benefits and risks of this option see our guide on <a href="layerec35.html?topicId=1084685982" title="How businesses can use cloud computing to cut IT costs and innovate more quickly">cloud computing</a>.</p>

			<p>You'll need to make sure that you comply with privacy and data protection rules about sales and marketing databases that hold personal information.
