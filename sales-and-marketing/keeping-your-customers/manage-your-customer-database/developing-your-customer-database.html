			<h1>Manage your customer database</h1>
			<h2>Developing your customer database</h2>
			<p>To get your marketing database working for you, it should include details of <strong>prospective</strong> as well as <strong>existing</strong> customers. People who enquire about your company should be included and 'flagged' for approach in the future.</p>
			<p>Only a percentage of the general population will buy your products or use your services. If you focus your marketing on them, your efforts will be more successful. Aim too widely with your marketing and you risk spreading your resources too thinly. For more information, see the page on how to <a href="detail06bb.html?itemId=1073790993&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="How to ensure your marketing emails are sent to carefully targeted recipients">target the right people</a> in our guide on <a href="layerb47a.html?topicId=1073919418" title="How to use email to promote your business and understand privacy and anti-spam rules">email marketing</a>.</p>
			<p>Not all customers have the same needs. It makes sense to build up a profile of your customers and group them according to their different requirements. This will give you a good idea of how likely they are to purchase what you are offering.</p>
			<p>Having established a customer profile, you should then consider looking for additional prospects by buying in a tailored database or list. Bear in mind that it is only usually possible to buy and sell personal information held in a database if the people concerned have agreed that their information can be passed on. For more information, see the page on <a href="detail8072.html?itemId=1073791469&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="The laws relating to marketing databases, including data protection and identification of commercial communication">rules about buying databases</a> in our guide on <a href="layerb47a.html?topicId=1073919418" title="How to use email to promote your business and understand privacy and anti-spam rules">email marketing</a>.</p>
			<p>For a fee, you could <a href="http://www.dma.org.uk/content/membership" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="DMA membership information">become a member of the Direct Marketing Association on the DMA website</a>, where you can find a registered direct marketing agency and promote your business by being listed in their directories.</p>
			<p>You can specify exactly what type of person or organisation you want on your list, in terms of the:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>size and type of the organisation - if you are selling to businesses</li>
				<li>age, gender, income or lifestyle - if you are selling to individual customers</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Lists are usually offered for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>rent - one-off use only</li>
				<li>sale - providing unlimited usage</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If the list is rented, most organisations forbid you from adding the names on the list to your database, except when you have received a response to your approach.</p>
			<p>You should therefore consider giving an attractive incentive, such as a generous offer to encourage your prospective customer to respond.</p>
