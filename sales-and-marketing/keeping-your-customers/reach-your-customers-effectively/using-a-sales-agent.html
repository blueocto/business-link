			<h1>Reach your customers effectively</h1>
			<h2>Using a sales agent</h2>
			<p>Instead of having to recruit, train and finance your own employees, you can use an <strong>outside sales agency</strong>. A good sales agent should already have the necessary contacts and skills.</p>
			<p>Use sales agents for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>building sales without heavy investment</li>
				<li>reaching specialist and overseas markets</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A clear, <b>written agreement</b> is essential. As a minimum it needs to cover:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>what 'territory' the agent is responsible for - eg a named foreign country</li>
				<li>whether this is exclusive - you could be barred from selling directly, or using any other agents in that territory</li>
				<li>how the agent will be paid (usually commission on sales)</li>
				<li>whether you will meet any of their expenses</li>
				<li>what rights you have to end the relationship</li>
				<li>what compensation payments you might have to make if you end the relationship</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Legal complications</h3>
			<p>An individual agent acting for you in the UK could legally be seen to be an <b>employee</b>. You would be required to treat the agent in the same way as other employees - eg deducting income tax under PAYE (Pay As You Earn) and paying National Insurance contributions. For further information, see our guides on <a href="layerd74d.html?topicId=1083051664" title="An overview of PAYE, including the rules, which forms and records you will need and dates and deadlines to remember">PAYE for employers: the basics</a> and on <a href="layerd4b2-2.html?topicId=1084472530" title="Employer responsibilities for National Insurance, the different National Insurance contributions classes, rates and category letters">National Insurance for employers: the basics</a>.</p>
			<p>Even if an individual agent is not an employee, there can still be complications:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Depending on the circumstances, you might be held responsible for the agent's actions.</li>
				<li>You may be responsible for any shortfalls you cause in the agent's earnings - eg if you fail to supply adequate stock.</li>
				<li>European and UK law can make it difficult to terminate an agency's contract without paying compensation. This could be as much as two years' expected earnings.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Before entering into any agency agreement, it's a good idea to take legal advice.</p>
