			<h1>Retain and grow your customer base</h1>
			<h2>Understand your customer base and your market</h2>
			<p>Encouraging existing customers to buy from you more often is a quicker, easier and cheaper way to increase sales than attracting new customers. A good customer retention strategy is based on how well you understand your customers, your competitors, and the market you are selling in.</p>
			<p>Your sales data will tell you a lot about your existing customers, for example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>how often your customers buy from you</li>
				<li>the type of products or services they buy</li>
				<li>the cost of the average transaction</li>
				<li>the average value of their order</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For more information on sales data, see our guide on how to <a href="layerea47.html?topicId=1073906150" title="How a customer database can enhance your business, what to include and how to maintain it">manage your customer database</a>.</p>
			<p>If you collect and use customer information, you may need to register with the Information Commissioner and comply with data protection regulations. For more information on data protection, see our guide on how to <a href="layerea71.html?topicId=1074412952" title="The correct use of personal information under the Data Protection Act 1998">comply with data protection legislation</a>.</p>
			<p>If you know who your <strong>competitors</strong> are, and what they are offering, you can:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>set your prices competitively</li>
				<li>improve your products and services</li>
				<li>respond to rival marketing campaigns with your own initiatives</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Technology can help automate some of these processes. For example, you can set up different mailshots or emails to go to different customer segments. E-commerce software can allow you to offer discounts to particular customer groups, or send selected customers 'e-coupons' to use in your online store.</p>

			<p>You can also use market research to help you understand the marketplace you are operating in.
