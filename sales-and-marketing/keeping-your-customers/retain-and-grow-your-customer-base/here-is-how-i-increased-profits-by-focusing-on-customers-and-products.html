			<h2>Here's how I increased profits by focusing on customers and products</h2>
			<p>After 12 years in business, the national training company Skills Training UK Ltd had growing turnover and a team that was working very hard. But profits weren't matching up to the directors' expectations. The management team, led by Simon Gotch, decided to reassess the business model - focusing on the company's most profitable customers and training programmes. The strategy has paid off, with improved training quality and growing profits.</p>
			<p><strong>What we did</strong></p>
			<h3>Start with the database</h3>
			<p>"Our customer database was key to the whole process. Without easily accessible data it would have been much harder to identify our most profitable customers and courses. We already had an extensive database, but we improved it by updating and cleaning all records so we could generate a variety of management reports. This gave us, at the touch of a button, the information we needed about our customers, by individual trainer, contract and location. Keeping the information up to date was also essential, so we put in place clear maintenance and updating procedures for all staff."</p>
			<h3>Time versus revenue</h3>
			<p>"When we looked at the facts and figures, we realised the issue wasn't with the quality of the service, but who we were delivering to. We were applying the same amount of effort, sometimes more, to contracts that were simply not viable. We found that compared with the revenue they generated the cost of servicing such customers was very high.</p>
			<p>"With further analysis, we identified contracts and training sectors that offered the best gross profit potential, and that's where we decided to focus our efforts. The most obvious opportunity, and the one that offered healthy gross profit margins and great growth potential, was training speakers of other languages in English.</p>
			<p>"We were already delivering this provision but simply did not have the management information to evaluate its contribution and assess its future prospects properly."</p>
			<h3>Improve the service</h3>
			<p>"Concentrating on our most profitable customers and courses has enabled us to develop our offering. It freed up valuable resources that had previously been focused on less profitable customers. We now offer a service that really adds value for our customers and taps into an area of major need. We spend more time in close consultation with customers and trainees, helping them to identify their training needs and assess skill levels.</p>
			<p>"This means we can deliver targeted training where it's most needed and at an appropriate level. We've also been able to expand the range of training options, including increased emphasis on 'blended learning', which combines tutor-led training with remote learning. It's helped us to foster long-term relationships with customers."</p>
			<p><strong>What we'd do differently</strong></p>
			<h3>React promptly</h3>
			<p>"When we could see turnover growth was not generating the profits it should, we could have reacted more quickly. The advantage of being an owner-managed business is that you can make decisions rapidly. If the financial information doesn't look good, do something about it sooner rather than later."</p>
			<h3>Consult employees</h3>
			<p>"Our employees have played a big role in improving the quality of our database and management information system. In retrospect, we should have involved our colleagues even earlier in the change process. After all, they're the ones using the databases and management systems, so they're in the best position to say how it can be improved. A thorough consultation process would have helped us get our systems up to scratch quicker."</p>
