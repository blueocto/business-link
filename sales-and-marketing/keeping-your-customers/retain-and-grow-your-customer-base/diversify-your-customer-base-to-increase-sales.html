			<h1>Retain and grow your customer base</h1>
			<h2>Diversify your customer base to increase sales</h2>
			<p>Understanding who your most valuable customers are helps focus your efforts to increase sales, but diversification is also important. Even if you have many customers, it's risky if they are too similar and could be affected by a similar change in business or the market. For example, if your three largest customers are based in the US, an unfavourable change in the exchange rate could see them all drastically reduce their orders.</p>
			<p>There are many ways you can diversify and grow your customer base - for example, you could aim to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>widen your customer base in your existing markets - see our guide on how to <a href="/grow-your-business/planning-how-to-grow/increase-your-market-share.php" title="How to increase sales and profit from existing customers, break into new markets and increase your overall share">increase your market share</a> </li>
				<li>use information about your competitors to take advantage of any gaps in the market- see our guide on how to <a href="/sales-and-marketing/marketing/understand-your-competitors.php" title="How to identify your competitors, find out more about them and then use this information to improve your business">understand your competitors</a> </li>
				<li>design and develop new products or services - see our section on <a href="layer7802.html?topicId=1079050015">growth through product and service development</a> </li>
				<li>form partnerships with other businesses - see our section on <a href="layereade.html?topicId=1079050369">growth through strategic partnering</a></li>
				<li>export your products or services - see our section on <a href="layer1429.html?topicId=1079050311">growth through international trade</a></li>
