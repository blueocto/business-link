			<h1>Manage your customer care</h1>
			<h2>Understand your customers</h2>
			<p>In business-to-business trading, providing a high level of customer care often requires you to find out what your customers want. Once you have identified your most valuable customers or best potential customers, you can target your highest levels of customer care towards them. Another approach, particularly in the consumer market, is the obligation to treat all consumers to the highest standard.</p>
			<h3>Collect information about your customers</h3>
			<p>Information about your customers and what they want is available from many sources, including:</p>
			<ul type="disc">
				<li>their order history</li>
				<li>records of their contacts with your business - phone calls, meetings and so on</li>
				<li>direct feedback - if you ask them, customers will usually tell you what they want</li>
				<li>changes in individual customers' order patterns</li>
				<li>changes in the overall success of specific products or services</li>
				<li>feedback about your existing range - what it does and doesn't do</li>
				<li>enquiries about possible new products or services</li>
				<li>feedback from your customers about things they buy from other businesses</li>
				<li>changes in the goods and services your competitors are selling</li>
				<li>feedback and referrals from other, non-competitive suppliers</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Manage your customer information</h3>
			<p>It's important that you draw up a plan about how customer information is to be gathered and used. Establish a customer-care policy. Assign a senior manager as the policy's champion but make sure that all your staff are involved - often less senior staff have more direct contact with customers.</p>
			<p>You can manage your customer records using a database or customer relationship management software. See our guides on <a href="layerb817.html?topicId=1075422922" title="How to use CRM to enhance the information you hold about your customers and the facilities CRM software can provide">customer relationship management</a> and how to <a href="layerea47.html?topicId=1073906150" title="How a customer database can enhance your business, what to include and how to maintain it">manage your customer database</a>.</p>
