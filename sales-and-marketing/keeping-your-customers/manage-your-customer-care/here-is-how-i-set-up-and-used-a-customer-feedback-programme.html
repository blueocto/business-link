			<h1>Here's how I set up and used a customer-feedback programme</h1>
			<h2>Here's how I set up and used a customer-feedback programme</h2>
			<p>Joe Ibrahim is director of the painting and decorating division of Axis Europe PLC, a London-based construction company. Joe wanted to find a way of measuring how effectively the business was performing - and devising a customer-feedback programme was one of a number of key performance indicators (KPIs) that the firm uses to measure its efficiency.</p>
			<p><strong>What I did</strong></p>
			<h3>Started simply</h3>
			<p>"We were looking for a proven way to measure our business performance and customer satisfaction seemed a good, basic place to start. So we devised a questionnaire for clients and we kept it tightly focused on the areas we wanted to measure.</p>
			<p>"One question, for example, was, 'Did the painters tidy up to your satisfaction?' The possible answers we offered clients were simple - either 'yes' or 'no' or a satisfaction-rating which ranged from one to ten and used faces going from scowls to smiles."</p>
			<h3>Home in on specific issues</h3>
			<p>"Any strong negative feedback is now immediately investigated, but otherwise we look at all the feedback from the jobs we've done half-yearly, present the findings on piecharts and search for any trends.</p>
			<p>"The results haven't always been what we've expected. For example, at first a lot of our clients - around 30 per cent - were saying that the contractors were not tidying up enough after themselves. That figure should be almost zero so we really attacked that problem.</p>
			<p>"We had a brainstorming session with contract managers and supervisors and discovered that often poor feedback is often driven by a perception of a problem rather than a real one. What we do now is not only be tidy but also highlight the perception of ourselves as tidy by using throwaway protective materials with our logo on. It's a way of exaggerating what we're doing.</p>
			<p>"Another common complaint discovered was about scaffolders leaving loose clips around. The scaffolders said they didn't do this but now for every clip found &pound;5 is donated to charity."</p>
			<h3>Share the finding</h3>
			<p>"I report back all the findings from my division to other divisional directors. It's important to help them introduce customer-feedback schemes and it also helps me again measure what we're achieving and therefore improve things further. The whole system works like a big circle, really.</p>
			<p>"We also have monthly meetings with all the staff where we talk about customer satisfaction, performance, KPIs and where the company is going."</p>
			<p><strong>What I'd do differently</strong></p>
			<h3>Not expect 100 per cent of clients to understand the importance of feedback</h3>
			<p>"We're learning as we go along. For the first three months we sent questionnaires out to clients by post with an SAE and the return levels were about 30 per cent. We then tried hand-delivering them for the next three months and we found we had 30 per cent returns again so we've gone back to the post. Hand-delivering takes a lot of time and 30 per cent is not a bad result."</p>
