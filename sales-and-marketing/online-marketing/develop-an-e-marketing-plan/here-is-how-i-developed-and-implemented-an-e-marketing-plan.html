			<h1>Here's how I developed and implemented an e-marketing plan</h1>
			<h2>Here's how I developed and implemented an e-marketing plan</h2>
			<p>Operating directly out of London's Covent Garden Market, Fruit For The Office provides daily fresh fruit deliveries and gifts to offices, households, schools, shops, hotels and restaurants. Founder Daniel Ox describes how his e-marketing plan played an important role in turning the market-stall based company into a thriving nationwide delivery business.</p>
			<p><strong>What I did</strong></p>
			<h3>Get the branding right</h3>
			<p>"Four years ago, our family business of fruit stalls in prime London locations was suffering from changing consumer shopping habits and the rise of the supermarkets. However, I had noticed that more and more companies were sending staff out to purchase quantities of fruit for general consumption in the office. I did some market research and financial forecasts to quantify the market potential and refine the target audience and became convinced that we could re-focus the business on this area, offering quality produce and an efficient delivery service direct to the customer's premises.</p>
			<p>"I realised that e-marketing was going to play a key role, simply because of the huge growth in internet commerce. I also felt that there was no point in jumping hastily on the bandwagon. I wanted to start with a great brand around which the marketing could be built and which would immediately inspire customer confidence. Branding was particularly important because we were the first company to specifically target fruit for offices and because the product itself is quite hard to differentiate from what future competitors could offer.</p>
			<p>"Utilising my research and comparisons with other successful food brands, I worked on the brand image with a trusted design company to formulate a company name and logo, an overall design blueprint and key marketing messages."</p>
			<h3>Put the online infrastructure in place</h3>
			<p>"E-marketing has to start with a good website. We already had a static one-page site to publicise the fruit stalls, but it wasn't up to the mark. Working with our design agency, we started again from scratch, planning in meticulous detail, testing pages for usability and search engine optimisation and ensuring we would be able to easily add content in future.</p>
			<p>"Data capture and building customer relationships are essential. We encourage visitors to sign up for our regular email newsletters, by including special offers, details of food festivals and other information that's of interest to our target market. We're careful to abide by Data Protection laws when collecting customer details and always gain opt-in rather than automatically adding someone to our list.</p>
			<p>"The website also includes a blog with feedback facilities, which reflects the brand personality and includes fun and informative fruit-related features plus company news such as our regular charity fund-raising efforts. We invested a lot of money in the website and a launch campaign, but it paid for itself within weeks of going live."</p>
			<h3>Monitor, review and update</h3>
			<p>"I use the Google Analytics tool every day to help monitor our e-marketing. It gives crucial information about how people are using the website and responding to our marketing messages, so that we can refine and develop them and segment the e-marketing further to reach specific customer groups. I also use the tool to analyse the performance of our competitors. In addition, we conduct an annual e-mail survey to gain customer feedback, the results of which are fed back to all staff.</p>
			<p>"We're constantly reviewing and updating our e-marketing plan to keep us ahead of the competition. For example, we're about to implement a huge data capture exercise using a bought-in database and offering fruit-related prizes as incentives to register with us. This should provide a major expansion of our own database for future e-marketing campaigns."</p>
			<p><strong>What I'd do differently</strong></p>
			<h3>Build in more landing pages</h3>
			<p>"The website has proved a highly successful e-marketing tool from day one. However I wish we'd originally built in more "landing pages" - the pages that potential customers are directed to when they type a particular keyword into a search engine."</p>
