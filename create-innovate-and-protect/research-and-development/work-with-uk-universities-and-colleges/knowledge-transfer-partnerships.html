			<h1>Work with UK universities and colleges</h1>
			<h2>Knowledge Transfer Partnerships</h2>
			<p>The Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTP) scheme operates throughout the UK and aims to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>help businesses gain knowledge and expertise from universities, colleges or research/technology organisations</li>
				<li>help businesses use knowledge, technology or skills to become more competitive through innovative projects</li>
				<li>make research organisations' work more relevant to businesses</li>
				<li>enhance the career prospects of graduates taking part in the scheme</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The KTP process allows you to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>identify an area where you need to make a strategic change to your business activities</li>
				<li>find a higher education institution, further education college or research organisation with the right expertise</li>
				<li>agree a project of between one and three years, during which time a recently qualified person is recruited to work in your business on the project</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Who can take part?</h3>
			<p>Businesses of all sizes in most industries and commercial sectors can take part, though some limitations apply. To find out if your business is eligible, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Knowledge Transfer Partnerships help research organisations to apply their knowledge to important business problems
">read about the KTP scheme on the KTP website</a>.</p>
			<h3>How to apply</h3>
			<p>Start your search for a potential partner - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-ukoffices" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Directory of KTP offices in the UK">find a KTP adviser or locate your nearest office on the KTP website</a>.</p>
			<p>Once you have found a KTP adviser, they will help you identify a partner organisation. You and your partner organisation will then complete a grant application and a partnership proposal form together.</p>
			<p>The KTP scheme is led by the Technology Strategy Board, an executive non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills, and funded by 15 government organisations. All applications must get final approval from the Technology Strategy Board before proceeding.</p>
			<h3>Shorter KTPs</h3>
			<p>A new shorter KTP of ten to 40 weeks was introduced in 2009. The shorter KTP is designed to be flexible and can act as a stepping-stone for those businesses that may not have worked with higher or further education institutions before.</p>
