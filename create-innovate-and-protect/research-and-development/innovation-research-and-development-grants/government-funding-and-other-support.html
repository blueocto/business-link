			<h1>Innovation, research and development grants</h1>
			<h2>Government funding and other support</h2>
			<p>Most grants for research and development (R&amp;D) have eligibility criteria covering the types of business which can apply and what the money can be used for.</p>
			<p>
				<p>For information on support in England, <a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/enterprise/docs/s/11-776-solutions-for-business-government-funded-business-support.pdf" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Support to help business meet their aspirations, improve and grow">download the Solutions for Business Government Funded Business Support: A Guide for Business from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills website (PDF, 118K)</a>. Some Solutions for Business products are only available in England and not all of the products are available in all regions, depending on local priorities.</p>
				<p>Government support for businesses is different in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

				<p>The Technology Strategy Board's Smart programme (previously known as the Grant for Research and Development) provides grants to help small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) in the UK who are working in any sector. The scheme is focused on supporting R&amp;D projects that are likely to offer the largest returns. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland run similar schemes. See the page in this guide on <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/research-and-development/innovation-research-and-development-grants/the-smart-programme.php" title="Smart can help you introduce technological innovation in your business">the Smart programme</a>.</p>
			</p>
			<p>Grants are also available for collaborative R&amp;D programmes in science and technology. See the page in this guide on <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/research-and-development/innovation-research-and-development-grants/collaborative-research-and-development.php" title="Details about grants for funding Collaborative Research and Development, and the Technology Strategy Board">collaborative research and development</a>.</p>
			<p>The Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) enables UK businesses to bid for public sector contracts to develop innovative technology products and services. See the page on <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/research-and-development/support-networks-and-facilities-for-innovation-and-r-and-d/the-small-business-research-initiative.php" title="The Small Business Research Initiative, how to apply, the SBRI process and the two main phases of the SBRI ">the Small Business Research Initiative</a> in our guide on <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/research-and-development/support-networks-and-facilities-for-innovation-and-r-and-d.php" title="Enterprise organisations and groups that can help your business with innovation, research and development">Support networks and facilities for innovation and R&amp;D</a>. </p>
			<p>The Department of Health (DH) commissions R&amp;D programmes that are considered vital to improvements in medicine and health. <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/PolicyAndGuidance/ResearchAndDevelopment/fs/en" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Access information on R&D funding on the Department of Health website">Find out about support for public health, health services and social care R&amp;D on the DH website</a>.</p>
			<p>Your business could also be eligible for finance from an Enterprise Capital Fund. These are composed of public and private money and provide equity finance to SMEs. However, these are temporary funds and subject to specific application deadlines. <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/enterprise/finance/enterprise-capital-funds/page37473.html" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Find information about Enterprise Capital Funds on the BIS website">Find out about Enterprise Capital Funds on the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (BIS) website</a>.</p>
			<h3>R&amp;D tax credits</h3>
			<p>R&amp;D tax credits provide tax relief for research and development which aims to achieve a scientific or technological advance. For more information, see the page on this guide on <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/research-and-development/innovation-research-and-development-grants/r-and-d-tax-credits.php" title="Tax relief for research and development that aims to achieve a scientific or technological advance">R&amp;D tax credits</a>.</p>

			<ul>

				</li>
