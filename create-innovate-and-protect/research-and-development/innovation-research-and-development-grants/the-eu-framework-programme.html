			<h1>Innovation, research and development grants</h1>
			<h2>The EU Framework Programme</h2>
			<p>The Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development is the European Union's (EU) main instrument for supporting and encouraging collaborative and transnational research, development and innovation in science, engineering and technology.</p>
			<h3>The Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)</h3>
			<p>FP7 is the current Framework Programme and covers the period from 2007 to 2013.</p>
			<p>FP7 consists of four specific programmes:</p>
			<p><strong>1. Co-operation</strong> - the largest component of FP7, this funds research activities involving transnational co-operation in ten thematic priority areas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					health
				</li>
				<li>
					food, agriculture, fisheries and biotechnology
				</li>
				<li>
					information and communication technologies
				</li>
				<li>
					nanosciences, nanotechnologies, materials and new production technologies
				</li>
				<li>
					energy
				</li>
				<li>
					environment (including climate change)
				</li>
				<li>
					transport (including aeronautics)
				</li>
				<li>
					socio-economic sciences and the humanities
				</li>
				<li>
					space
				</li>
				<li>
					security
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>2. Ideas</strong> - funding for 'investigator-driven' research projects across all fields,carried out by individual teams in European competition and delivered by the European Research Council.</p>
			<p><strong>3. People</strong> - so-called 'Marie Curie actions' and other training initiatives aimed at the mobility of researchers. The budget is greater than previous framework programmes and more emphasis is given to industry-academic transfers.</p>
			<p><strong>4. Capacities</strong> - the Capacities programme aims to enhance research and innovation capacities throughout Europe in the following areas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					support to new and existing research infrastructures
				</li>
				<li>
					research for the benefit of small and medium-sized enterprises
				</li>
				<li>
					regions of knowledge and support for regional research-driven clusters
				</li>
				<li>
					research potential
				</li>
				<li>
					science in society
				</li>
				<li>
					support to the coherent development of research policies
				</li>
				<li>
					international co-operation with third countries
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Applying to FP7</h3>
			<p>The European Commission will invite bids through calls for proposals in each area. The calls, typically one or two each year, specify the areas of research to be supported. They usually give at least three months' notice of the deadline for submission of a proposal.</p>
			<p>The Commission has produced a guide to EU funding opportunities for research and innovation, to help business find the right option among the available EU programmes. <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/eu-funding-guide/finding-sources_en.html" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Guidance on finding the right EU funding option on the CORDIS website">Read a guide to relevant funding sources on the Community Research and Development Information Service (CORDIS) website</a>.</p>
			<p>Proposals need to be of a very high standard to be considered and must meet the objectives and time-scales of the relevant work programme. For help with the application process contact the Business Link Helpline on Tel 0845 600 9 006.</p>
			<p>Scotland has an integrated support service for Scottish Enterprise companies and strategic projects to maximise access to EU R&amp;D funding.
