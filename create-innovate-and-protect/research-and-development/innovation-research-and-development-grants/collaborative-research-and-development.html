			<h1>Innovation, research and development grants</h1>
			<h2>Collaborative research and development</h2>
			<p>Collaborative Research and Development (R&amp;D) funding provides grants to help develop the knowledge for new products and services, while cutting the cost burden associated with bringing research to market. These grants are delivered by the Technology Strategy Board and are available throughout the UK.</p>
			<p>Competitions for funding are run in specific technology focus areas. Eligible projects must involve two or more collaborators, at least one of which is from a business. If your application is successful, you can expect to receive a grant of between 25 per cent and 75 per cent of your total R&amp;D costs. Projects can range from short feasibility studies to longer term in depth R&amp;D.</p>
			<p>The Technology Strategy Board provides investment to encourage innovation in science, engineering and technology. It aims to help with the cost burden and share the risk involved when businesses bring new ideas and technologies to market. It also aims to cultivate communities of interest around major up-and-coming technologies.</p>
			<p>The Technology Strategy Board has identified specific focus areas which include high value manufacturing, advanced materials, biosciences, electronics, photonics and electrical systems, information and communication technology, and nanotechnology, medicines and healthcare, energy generation and supply, transport, environmental sustainability, the built environment, creative industries and high-value services.</p>
