			<h1>Innovation, research and development grants</h1>
			<h2>The Smart programme</h2>
			<p>
				<p>If you operate a small to medium-sized enterprise in any sector in the UK, you could apply for funding from the Technology Strategy Board's Smart programme (previously known as the Grant for Research and Development).</p>
				<p>In order to qualify, the research and development (R&amp;D) project you want to fund must be in the area of science, technology or engineering, and you must be able to show that the project is likely to produce significant returns. Funding is only open to single companies.</p>
				<p>You can apply for one of three types of grant:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Proof of Market</strong> - funding market research and testing, competitor analysis, intellectual property issues and planning costs associated with taking the product or service to market. A grant of up to &pound;25,000 is available as long as this accounts for no more than 60 per cent of the total project cost. The project must last no longer than nine months.</li>
					<li><strong>Proof of Concept</strong> - funding feasibility studies, prototyping, testing, protection of intellectual property and analysis of likely production techniques. A grant of up to &pound;100,000 is available as long as this accounts for no more than 60 per cent of the total project cost. The project must last no longer than 18 months.</li>
					<li><strong>Development of Prototype</strong> - funding demonstration models, protection of intellectual property, any trials or testing (including market testing) required. A grant of up to &pound;250,000 is available as long as this accounts for no more than 35 per cent of the total project cost for medium-sized businesses, and no more than 45 per cent for small businesses. The project must last no longer than two years.</li>
