			<h1>Innovation, research and development grants</h1>
			<h2>EUREKA</h2>
			<p>EUREKA is a pan-European network for encouraging market-oriented, transnational, collaborative research and development (R&amp;D) projects, which lead to the development of innovative products, processes or services.</p>
			<p>Projects can be in any technological area and there are no restrictions on project size, timing or length. The network involves organisations from 38 European countries and the Commission of the European Union (EU).</p>
			<p>EUREKA is not a funding mechanism in itself and there is no central EU budget for supporting EUREKA projects. In common with most other member countries, the UK may sometimes provide funding support to project participants, up to a maximum of 50 per cent of the total project cost. However, many projects go ahead unfunded.</p>
			<p>One of the main strengths of EUREKA is its <b>networking</b> mechanism. You may have a project idea but need <b>partners</b> to take the project forward. EUREKA offers a simple and easy-to-access partner-search facility. You can <a href="http://www.eurekanetwork.org/activities" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Use the search facility on the EUREKA website to find research projects or partners">find information on research projects or partners on the EUREKA website</a>.</p>
			<p>You can also <a href="http://www.eurekanetwork.org/projects/participate" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Propose an R&D project on the EUREKA website">propose a research and development project idea on the EUREKA website</a>. Your project idea can then be advertised on the website and circulated around the EUREKA network.</p>
			<p>EUREKA is a potential partner programme for the Smart programme (formerly the Grant for Research and Development). For example, you can use EUREKA to form collaborations and Smart to fund the UK element of the project. See the page in this guide on the <a href="detail2ca4.html?itemId=1074469930&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="Smart can help you introduce technological innovation in your business">the Smart programme</a>.</p>

			<p>UK companies seeking a larger grant than is available from Smart may consider applying to one of the Technology Strategy Board's Collaborative R&amp;D competitions to fund their participation in a EUREKA project.</p>
			<h3>Eurostars</h3>
			<p>Eurostars is a joint programme between the Eureka network, the European Commission and EU member states. It provides grant funding to near-market R&amp;D projects led by research-intensive small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
			<p>You can <a href="http://www.eurostars-eureka.eu/" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="EUREKA's Eurostars funding and support programme is specifically dedicated to SMEs">find information and guidance on the Eurostars programme on the Eurostars website</a>.</p>
