			<h1>Technology Strategy Board</h1>
			<h2>The Small Business Research Initiative</h2>
			<p>The Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) encourages innovation by bringing the public sector and businesses together. It initiates competitions between businesses in a variety of sectors to develop new technologies or ideas in order to solve the needs of government departments. This encourages innovation and idea development, and gives businesses the opportunity to win a short-term development contract with the government.</p>
			<p>The SBRI is particularly suitable for new, small or medium-sized businesses, as it can provide vital funding for the critical product development stage, and can result in a commercial product or service. If your business wins an SBRI competition, you will receive a contract for the full cost of developing your technology or product. This will allow you to supply the government as a contractor, and provides a route to market.</p>
			<p>If you are a new or developing business, being successful within the SBRI can benefit you in a number of ways, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>gaining a contract with a government department or public body - which is often difficult but beneficial</li>
				<li>gaining a route to market and strengthening your ability to secure investment</li>
				<li>allowing you to prove and establish your technology or idea - this can provide a good base for future innovation and development</li>
				<li>retaining intellectual property for your business</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can <a href="http://www.innovateuk.org/deliveringinnovation/smallbusinessresearchinitiative.ashx" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Explanation of the initiative to encourage business innovation through government procurement">find out about the SBRI on the Technology Strategy Board website</a>.</p>
			<h3>How does the SBRI work?</h3>
			<p>The SBRI matches the needs of government departments with the ideas and technology of small and medium-sized businesses by advertising a specific need or problem of a particular government department, and opening the solution up to businesses. The competition is usually outcome-based, so in order to be successful, your idea should be:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>able to resolve the listed problem</li>
				<li>innovative</li>
				<li>scientifically and technically realistic</li>
				<li>commercially viable</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Any business can apply to the SBRI competition, though it is most likely to benefit new or smaller businesses. Your application can be made through the Technology Strategy Board or directly to the relevant government department, depending on the conditions of the competition.</p>
			<p>Once all applications have been received, the successful ideas will be reviewed in two phases:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Demonstration of feasibility - this usually lasts about six months, and in order to be successful, you must be able to prove your idea is scientifically and commercially viable. This stage can be worth between &pound;50,000 and &pound;100,000.</li>
				<li>Prototype development - if your project is successful at phase one, you may be supported in developing a working prototype. This stage can be worth between &pound;250,000 and &pound;1 million.</li>
