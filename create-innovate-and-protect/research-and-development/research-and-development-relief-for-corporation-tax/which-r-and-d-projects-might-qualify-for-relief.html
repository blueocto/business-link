            <h1>Research and Development (R&amp;D) Relief for Corporation Tax</h1>
            <h2>Which R&amp;D projects might qualify for Relief?</h2>
            <p>Your company or organisation can only claim for R&amp;D Relief if an R&amp;D project seeks to achieve an advance in overall knowledge or capability in a field of science or technology through the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty - and not simply an advance in its own state of knowledge or capability.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, for accounting periods ending before 9 December 2009, the project must satisfy both of the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>it must be related to your company or organisation's trade - either an existing one, or one that you intend to start up based on the results of the R&amp;D</li>
                <li>if your company or organisation is claiming relief under the Small or Medium-sized Enterprise Scheme, it must own any intellectual property that might arise from the project</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For accounting periods ending on or after 9 December 2009, only the first condition applies because the second condition has now been abolished and won't apply to relevant expenditure for accounting periods ending on or after that date.</p>

            <h3>How to show the project is R&amp;D within the tax definition</h3>
            <p>There are guidelines that define all the following terms, and it's important to understand these concepts before attempting to reach a view on whether your company or organisation has an R&amp;D project for tax purposes.</p>
            <p>The terms are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>project</li>
                <li>advance in science or technology</li>
                <li>science</li>
                <li>technology</li>
                <li>directly contribute</li>
                <li>scientific or technological uncertainty</li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/cirdmanual/CIRD81900.htm" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Definition and appeals on research and development">Find definitions of key R&amp;D Relief terms on the HMRC website</a></p>
            <p>It's helpful to present the following questions - with your own answers - when filing your Company Tax Return, so HMRC can see your view of how the definition of R&amp;D applies to your project or projects.</p>
            <h3>What is the scientific or technological advance?</h3>
            <p>Rather than stating the name of the product, process, functionality, etc, being developed you should consider what scientific or technological advance is being sought. This focuses attention on the project's aim for an advance, which is the key issue in judging whether R&amp;D for tax purposes is being undertaken.</p>
            <p>Science does not include work in the arts, humanities and social sciences - including economics.</p>
            <p>It's not enough that a product is commercially innovative. You cannot claim in respect of projects to develop innovative business products or services that don't incorporate any advance in science or technology.</p>
            <h3>What were the scientific or technological uncertainties involved in the project?</h3>
            <p>Scientific or technological uncertainty exists when knowledge of whether something is scientifically possible or technologically feasible, or how to achieve it in practice, is not readily available or deducible by a competent professional working in the field.</p>
            <p>But uncertainties that can be resolved through relatively brief discussions with peers are routine uncertainties rather than technological uncertainties. Technical problems that have been overcome in previous projects on similar systems are not likely to be technological uncertainties.</p>
            <p>You should set out at a high level, in a form understandable to the non-expert, what these uncertainties were and when they started and ended.</p>
            <h3>How and when were the uncertainties actually overcome?</h3>
            <p>Describe the methods adopted to overcome the uncertainties and the investigations and analysis undertaken. This should not be in great detail, simply sufficient to show that the matter was not straightforward. Describe the successes and failures and the impact of these on the overall project. If the uncertainties were not overcome, explain what happened.</p>
            <h3>Why was the knowledge being sought not readily deducible by a competent professional?</h3>
            <p>It might be publicly known that others have attempted to resolve the uncertainties and failed, or perhaps that others have resolved the uncertainties but that precisely how it was done is not in the public domain. In either case, a valid technological uncertainty can still exist.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, if the project is one where there is little public information available, you'll need to show that the persons leading the R&amp;D project are themselves competent professionals working in the relevant field. This might be done by outlining their relevant background, professional qualifications and recent experience. Then have them explain why they consider the uncertainties are scientific or technological uncertainties rather than routine uncertainties.</p>
            <p>Whichever is appropriate set out the details and have evidence available if needed.</p>
