			<h1>Importance of knowledge management to a growing business</h1>
			<h2>Make knowledge central to your business</h2>
			<p>In order to manage the collection and exploitation of knowledge in your business, consider the following knowledge management methods.</p>
			<h3>Build a knowledge sharing culture</h3>
			<p>You should try to build a <b>culture</b> in which knowledge is valued across your business. One way to do this might be to offer incentives to staff who supply useful market news or suggest ways customers can be better served.</p>
			<p>You can use these knowledge management practices throughout your organisation to build better processes. For more information, see the page in this guide on <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/create-and-improve-products-and-services/importance-of-knowledge-management-to-a-growing-business/sharing-knowledge-across-your-business.php" title="How to share knowledge between different areas of the business">sharing knowledge across your business</a>.</p>
			<h3>Protect and exploit your knowledge</h3>
			<p>As part of your knowledge management, you should also make sure that any <b>intellectual property</b> that your business holds is protected. This means that you have the right to stop competitors from copying it - and also allows you to profit by licensing your business' knowledge. See our guide on <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/protecting-your-intellectual-property/find-value-you-didnt-know-existed-in-your-business/protecting-intellectual-property.php" title="How to conduct an audit of your business' intellectual property rights and take steps to protect and secure IP">protecting intellectual property</a>.</p>
			<p>Protecting and exploiting your knowledge base will be more effective if you develop efficient systems for storing and retrieving information. Your files - whether stored digitally or on paper - contain knowledge that you can use to make your products, services, systems and processes better and more customer-focused.</p>
			<h3>Keep knowledge confidential</h3>
			<p>Your employment policies play a central role in keeping your knowledge confidential. For example, you might get staff to sign non-disclosure agreements (also known as confidentiality agreements) when they join the business as this ensures that they understand the importance of confidentiality from day one.</p>
			<p>Employment contracts can be written to reasonably limit your employees' freedom to leave and go to work immediately for one of your rivals (restraint of trade clauses) or set up a competing business to yours in the vicinity (restrictive covenants).</p>
