			<h1>Importance of knowledge management to a growing business</h1>
			<h2>Exploiting your knowledge</h2>
			<p>Consider the measurable benefits of capturing and using knowledge more effectively. The following are all possible outcomes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> An improvement in the <strong>goods or services</strong> you offer and the processes that you use to sell them. For example, identifying market trends before they happen might enable you to offer products and services to customers before your competitors.</li>
				<li> Increased <strong>customer satisfaction</strong> because you have a greater understanding of their requirements through feedback from customer communications.</li>
				<li> An increase in the quality of your <strong>suppliers</strong>, resulting from better awareness of what customers want and what your staff require.</li>
				<li> Improved <strong>staff productivity</strong>, because employees are able to benefit from colleagues' knowledge and expertise to find out the best way to get things done. They'll also feel more appreciated in a business where their ideas are listened to.</li>
				<li> Increased business <strong>efficiency</strong>, by making better use of in-house expertise.</li>
				<li> Better <strong>recruitment and staffing</strong> policies. For instance, if you have increased knowledge of what your customers are looking for, you're better able to find the right staff to serve them.</li>
				<li> The ability to <strong>sell or license</strong> your knowledge to others. You may be able to use your knowledge and expertise in an advisory or consultancy capacity. In order to do so, though, make sure that you protect your intellectual property.
