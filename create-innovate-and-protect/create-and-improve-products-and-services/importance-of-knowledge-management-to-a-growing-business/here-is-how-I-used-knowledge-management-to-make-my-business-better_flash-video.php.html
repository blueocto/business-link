							<li>"Don't try and boil the ocean. It's tempting to try and do too much at once but a gradual implementation is more likely to be successful."</li>
							<li>"Base your framework on business goals. If your colleagues can see how the knowledge management framework is supporting the business you're more likely to get the adoption you need."</li>
							<li>"Lead by example. If your colleagues don't see senior people, including yourself, actually contributing to these knowledge management systems then they're far less likely to do so themselves."</li>
