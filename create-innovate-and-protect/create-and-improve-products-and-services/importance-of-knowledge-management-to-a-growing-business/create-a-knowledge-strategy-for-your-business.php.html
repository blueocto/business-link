			<h1>Importance of knowledge management to a growing business</h1>
			<h2>Create a knowledge strategy for your business</h2>
			<p>If you want to get the most from your business' knowledge, you need to take a strategic approach to <b>discovering</b>, <b>collating</b> and <b>sharing</b> it. This is done via a knowledge strategy - a set of written guidelines to be applied across the business.</p>
			<h3>Getting managerial support for your knowledge strategy</h3>
			<p>If your strategy is to be effective, you must make sure your senior managers are committed to it and are fully aware of the benefits it can bring. Discuss with them the best ways of collecting and using knowledge.</p>
			<p>You may decide to appoint a senior manager as <b>knowledge champion</b> for your business. For more information see the page in this guide on how to <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/create-and-improve-products-and-services/importance-of-knowledge-management-to-a-growing-business/make-knowledge-central-to-your-business.php" title="How to manage and access all knowledge contained in your business">make knowledge central to your business</a>.</p>
			<h3>What to consider when creating a knowledge strategy</h3>
			<p>When you're drawing up the strategy, you need to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>consider how effective your business currently is at using its knowledge</li>
				<li>analyse your internal processes for gathering and sharing information - including ways of generating ideas and the staff's grasp of what is happening</li>
				<li>make sure that knowledge management, acquisition and distribution is a continuing process, so that it becomes central to your business' strategy</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Identify the value of knowledge to your business and ways you could exploit it for financial gain - perhaps by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Gaining a larger market share.</li>
				<li>Developing new products.</li>
				<li>Selling or licensing your protected intellectual property to others. Ensure this fits in with your overall business plan.
