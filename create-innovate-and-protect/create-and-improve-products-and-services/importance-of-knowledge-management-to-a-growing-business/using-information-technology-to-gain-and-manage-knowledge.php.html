			<h1>Importance of knowledge management to a growing business</h1>
			<h2>Using information technology to gain and manage knowledge</h2>
			<p>Information technology offers powerful tools to help you gain and make the best use of knowledge. Some of the systems can be complex to set up and time-consuming to maintain. You need to choose systems that fit with your business and that will improve it without becoming a burden. You may find it useful to consult an IT specialist.</p>
			<p>The main types of information technology used in knowledge management are described below.</p>
			<h3>Database tools</h3>
			<p><b>Databases</b> organise information so it can be easily accessed, managed and updated. For instance, you might have a database of customers containing their contact information, their orders and preferences. For more information, see our guide on the <a href="/it-and-ecommerce/software-and-business-applications/benefits-of-databases.php" title="How businesses can make use of database technology to control and manage information more effectively">benefits of databases</a>.</p>
			<p><b>A data warehouse</b> is a central storage area you might use if you have a variety of business systems, or a range of information in different digital formats. Many businesses now use digital asset management to store, manage and retrieve information, and this can be particularly helpful if you sell online. It is, however, a complex area technically and in task management, so you may wish to seek specialist advice from an IT consultant. See our guide to ensure that you <a href="/it-and-ecommerce/data-protection-and-legal-issues/comply-with-data-protection-legislation.php" title="The correct use of personal information under the Data Protection Act 1998">comply with data protection legislation</a>.</p>
			<p><b>Data mining</b> is a process in which all the data you collect is sorted to determine patterns. For instance, it can tell you which products are most popular and whether one type of customer is likely to buy a particular item. <a href="http://databases.about.com/od/datamining/a/datamining.htm" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="How your business can use data mining">Read an introduction to data mining on the About website</a>.</p>
			<p><b>Reporting and querying tools</b> let you create reports interpreting data in a particular way. How many of your sales have been handled by one particular employee, for instance?</p>
			<h3>Web-based tools</h3>
			<p><b>Business intelligence portals</b> are websites that bring together all sorts of potentially useful information, such as legal issues or details of new research.</p>
			<p><strong>The internet and search engines</strong> can be a powerful source of knowledge, although be certain to check the credibility of your information source. Internet newsgroups can be specific sources of business information, but check the authors' other postings before deciding how to view their opinions and claimed facts.</p>
			<p>An <b>intranet</b> is a secure internal network for the sole use of your business. <a href="http://www.intranetjournal.com/faqs/whatis/index.html" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="An information website about Intranets and  resources needed for building intranets">Read about the benefits of intranets on the Intranet Journal website</a>.</p>
			<p>An <b>extranet</b> is similar to an intranet but can be extended to customers and suppliers. <a href="http://www.ncc.co.uk/article/?articleref=154052" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="How extranets can help your business to enhance how it managers suppliers">Read about the benefits of extranets on the National Computing Centre website</a>.</p>
			</p>
			<p><strong>Social software</strong>, such as wikis, blogs and social networking sites, can also be useful when it comes to sharing knowledge.</p>
			<p>A wiki is a website that allows different users to publish and edit the same pages quickly, making it possible for teams to record their collective knowledge. A blog allows one individual to share knowledge with other people in a business and social networking sites are an easy way to communicate informally.</p>
			<p>You can read more about these tools in our guide <a href="layer0e0a.html?topicId=1081903314" title="How you can make the most of the changing internet to benefit your business">web 2.0: a guide for business</a>. </p>
			<h3>Customer analysis tools<br />
			</h3>
			<p><b>Customer relationship management software</b> helps you build up a profile of your customer database and enables you to target them through email, telephone or postal marketing campaigns. See our guide on <a href="layerb817.html?topicId=1075422922" title="How to use CRM to enhance the information you hold about your customers and the facilities CRM software can provide">customer relationship management</a>.</p>
			<p><b>Call-centre systems</b> enable you to serve large numbers of customers if you sell by telephone.</p>
			<p><b>Website log-file analysis</b> helps you to analyse how customers use your website so you can improve its effectiveness.</p>
			<p><b>Systems to analyse and file</b> customer letters, suggestions, emails, and call-centre responses, which will enable you to spot trends, improve customer service and develop new products, services and systems.</p>
