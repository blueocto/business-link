			<h1>Importance of knowledge management to a growing business</h1>
			<h2>Sharing knowledge across your business</h2>
			<p>If only a few people in your business hold important knowledge or skills, there is a danger that these will be lost if they leave or retire.</p>
			<p>Even a short period of unexpected absence, eg due to illness or bereavement, could cause problems if knowledge has not been shared. If you have efficient ways of sharing knowledge across the business, it will be more widely used and its value and effectiveness is likely to be maximised.</p>
			<h3>Knowledge sharing</h3>
			<p>Consider the best ways of sharing new ideas and information with your staff. You may already have regular meetings when you can brief employees and ask them to share ideas and best practice.</p>
			<p>Consider holding <b>innovation workshops</b> or <b>brainstorming sessions</b> at which staff are given the freedom and encouragement to think of ways in which the business could improve.</p>
			<p>It can also be a good idea to create a <strong>knowledge bank</strong> containing useful information and instructions on how to carry out key tasks. Putting this on an intranet is ideal as it will encourage staff to post news or suggestions.</p>
			<h3>Knowledge management</h3>
			<p>Technology alone isn't the answer to sharing knowledge - it has to be managed carefully so that information is channelled properly. You may decide to appoint a senior manager as <b>knowledge champion</b> for your business. See the page in this guide on how to <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/create-and-improve-products-and-services/importance-of-knowledge-management-to-a-growing-business/make-knowledge-central-to-your-business.php" title="How to manage and access all knowledge contained in your business">make knowledge central to your business</a>.</p>
			<h3>Incentives and training</h3>
			<p>Remember that offering staff incentives to come up with suggestions for how the business can be improved is often an effective way of getting them to use and share knowledge. See our guide on how to <a href="layer78a3.html?topicId=1074424257" title="Benefit from implementing staff perks and incentives and what incentives you can offer">implement staff incentive schemes</a>.</p>
			<p>Don't forget the importance of training in spreading key knowledge, skills and best practice across your business.</p>
