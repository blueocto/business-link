            <h1>Exports, dispatches, supplying goods abroad: charging VAT</h1>
            <h2>VAT on sales to someone who isn't VAT registered in another EU country</h2>
            <h3>What counts as a sale to another European Union (EU) country?</h3>
            <p>If you supply goods to a customer in another EU country who isn't registered for VAT in that country, and you are responsible for delivery - that is, they don't collect them - then this is called a 'distance sale'. The most common examples are mail order or internet sales to private individuals in another EU country.</p>
            <p>However, if you transfer your own goods to another EU country - whether to another part of your organisation, or simply to put in storage - this is treated as if you had made a supply in this country and an acquisition in the destination country. You may therefore have to account for UK VAT unless you are also registered for VAT in the EU country to which they are sent - in which case they can be zero-rated assuming all the usual conditions are met. You may also have to account for acquisition VAT in that country, and so have to be registered there.</p>
            <h3>Do you need to register for VAT in other EU countries?</h3>
            <p>For distance sales, you must charge VAT at UK rates in the normal way. However, each country has a 'distance selling threshold'. If the value of your sales to that country exceeds this threshold, you must register for VAT in that country, and charge their rate of VAT on sales to that country.</p>
            <p><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/distance_selling/index_en.htm" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Find out about distance selling of goods on the European Commission website">Find the distance selling thresholds for each EU country on the European Commission website</a> </p>
            <h3>How do you charge VAT to someone in another EU country?</h3>
            <p>If you sell goods or services to someone who isn't VAT registered in another EU country, you must charge VAT in the normal way - just as you would for a UK customer.</p>
            <p><a href="layer685c.html?topicId=1083245578" title="When you invoice a customer in a foreign currency you must convert the VAT on the sale into sterling, using one of two methods">Foreign currency transactions and VAT</a></p>
            <p>You include the sale in your VAT Return for the period when the tax point takes place. This is just the same as for sales to UK customers.</p>
            <h3>Excise goods</h3>
            <p>If you supply excise goods (goods on which excise duty is payable, such as alcohol or tobacco) to someone who isn't registered for VAT in another EU country, the VAT treatment depends on whether they are delivered by you or collected by your customer.</p>
            <p>If you deliver the goods (or arrange for them to be delivered), they are treated as distance sales in the country to which they are delivered, and you'll have to register for VAT there regardless of the value of the sales.</p>
            <p>If the customer collects them the supply can be zero-rated, unless they are for private consumption in which case they are liable to UK VAT in the normal way.</p>
            <h3>Reporting requirements for EU sales where VAT is charged</h3>
            <p>If you have made EU sales where you have charged VAT, include the value of the sales in box 1 and box 6 on your return, and pay HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) any VAT you have charged in the usual way. You will not have to report these sales on an EC Sales List.</p>
            <p>However, you'll have to complete an Intrastat Supplementary Declaration if your sales to other EU customers exceed &pound;250,000 of goods in a year.</p>
