			<h1>Here's how I handled the sale of my business</h1>
			<h2>Here's how I handled the sale of my business</h2>
			<p>Bill Carey-Evans set up IT consultancy Delphis Holdings Limited in 1996. In 2000, having built up the service-based company to 300 people, he sold it to Morse plc, signing a three-year earn-out deal to the value of &pound;40 million.</p>
			<p><strong>What I did</strong></p>
			<h3>Tighten the business' record-keeping and reporting</h3>
			<p>"I'm an entrepreneurial type - a little eccentric and good with people, but incredibly chaotic. So when I wanted to build an exit strategy I bought a very small company purely for the two people who ran it, who were painstaking about detail and very process-driven. </p>
			<p>"They came in and saw a great business but one that was flaky in terms of process. They helped put in the foundations that the business needed for an exit - excellent detailed financial records and management reporting, systems checks, and spot-on forecasting tools and models.</p>
			<p>"We also appointed tax advisers. I knew one of the warranties we'd be signing for a sale was a tax one. We always made sure that our Corporation Tax and VAT was paid accurately and on time anyway, but a sales process makes you really double-check everything. I didn't want to find myself facing a tax liability at a later date."</p>
			<h3>Use EMI to motivate key staff </h3>
			<p>"When we were getting ready for the exit we granted Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI), which are tax-advantaged share options. Under EMI, Capital Gains Tax Taper Relief runs from when the share options are granted rather than when they are exercised, so it was incredibly motivating during the earn-out period for the 12 members of staff who had them."</p>
			<h3>Keep the business running efficiently</h3>
			<p>"We needed people completely focused on the business. So that we wouldn't disrupt the rest of the company, only four of us knew about the sale. Only one or two of us worked on the sale at any one time, but we had daily update meetings to keep the others informed. We had to be conscious at all times that it could be expensive if the sale failed."</p>
			<p><strong>What I'd do differently</strong></p>
			<h3>Take early advice on corporate structure</h3>
			<p>"We made sure that as many people as possible in the company made something from the earn-out deal. Nearly everybody had share options.</p>
			<p>"I knew share ownership in a business was the right way to move forward but I should have had a relationship from day one with lawyers who could get me through the nuances of company structure. Setting up a share structure correctly is very difficult and I should have set up a scheme that incentivised people rather than just gave immediate rewards."</p>
