            <h1>Introduction to Corporation Tax</h1>
            <h2>What you need to do for Corporation Tax and when you need to do it</h2>
            <p>If your company or organisation is subject to Corporation Tax requirements you must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>tell</strong> HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) that it's liable for Corporation Tax</li>
                <li><strong>pay</strong> the right amount of Corporation Tax on time and electronically</li>
                <li><strong>file</strong> a Company Tax Return and supporting documents online and in a particular format</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are different deadlines for each of these requirements. If you don't meet those deadlines, your company or organisation may be charged interest and/or penalties.</p>
            <h3>Pay before you file</h3>
            <p>Unlike other taxes such as Income Tax or VAT - where in most cases the filing and payment deadlines are identical - this is not the case with Corporation Tax. The deadline to pay your Corporation Tax is before the deadline to file your Company Tax Return. Generally, you must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>pay by 9 months</strong> and one day after the end of your company or organisation's Corporation Tax accounting period</li>
                <li><strong>file by 12 months</strong> after the end of your company or organisation's Corporation Tax accounting period</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, if your company or organisation's financial year runs from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012, and your Corporation Tax accounting period is the same, you must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>pay your Corporation Tax for that period by 1 January 2013</li>
                <li>file your Company Tax Return for that period by 31 March 2013</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your company's profits for an accounting period are at an annual rate of more than &pound;1.5 million, you must normally pay your Corporation Tax for that period in instalments, all of which are due <strong>before</strong> the deadline to file your Company Tax Return.</p>
