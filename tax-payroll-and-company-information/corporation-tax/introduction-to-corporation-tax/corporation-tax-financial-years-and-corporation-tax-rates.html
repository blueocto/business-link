    <h1>Introduction to Corporation Tax</h1>
    <h2>Corporation Tax financial years and Corporation Tax rates</h2>
    <h3>Corporation Tax financial years</h3>
    <p>For Corporation Tax, the tax year is called the 'financial year' or 'fiscal year' and runs from 1 April to 31 March. This is different from the tax year for individual taxpayers, which runs from 6 April to 5 April.</p>
    <p>The Chancellor sets out the rates of Corporation Tax and various allowances, reliefs and credits in the Budget each year (usually in March or April) and also in the Pre-Budget Report the previous November/December. Normally any changes are announced one or more financial years in advance of the year to which they will apply.</p>
    <h3>Corporation Tax rates</h3>
    <p>There are currently two rates of Corporation Tax, depending on the company or organisation's taxable profits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the lower rate - known as the 'small profits' rate</li>
        <li>the upper rate - known as the 'full' rate or 'main' rate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is also a sliding scale between the lower and upper rates known as 'Marginal Relief'.</p>
    <p>This means if your company or organisation's profits fall between certain limits, you pay the full rate of Corporation Tax but it is reduced by Marginal Relief.</p>
    <p>For more information, see our guide on <a href="layerabc5.html?topicId=1082148483" title="Current main rate of Corporation Tax, small profits rate, Marginal Relief thresholds and fractions for calculating relief">Corporation Tax rates</a>.</p>
    <p>You can also see our guide on <a href="layerb8f9.html?topicId=1083648984" title="Marginal Relief can reduce the Corporation Tax your company or organisation has to pay">Marginal Relief for Corporation Tax</a>.</p>
    <h3>If your Corporation Tax accounting period doesn't coincide with the Corporation Tax financial year</h3>
    <p>If your accounting period doesn't run from 1 April to 31 March it spans two Corporation Tax financial years. You'll need to apportion your company's taxable profits between the two financial years on a time basis.</p>
    <p>For example, if your company's Corporation Tax accounting period runs from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The first 9 months (274 days) fall into Corporation Tax financial year 2011 (from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012). So you'll pay tax on 274/365ths of your taxable profit at the financial year 2011 rates.</li>
        <li>The remaining 3 months (91 days) fall into the financial year 2012 (from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013). So you'll pay tax on 91/365ths of your taxable profit at the financial year 2012 rates.</li>
    </ul>
