            <h1>Unincorporated organisations and Corporation Tax</h1>
            <h2>Corporation Tax for unincorporated organisations</h2>
            <p>The following unincorporated organisations are generally subject to Corporation Tax deadlines and requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>members' clubs - such as social clubs and holiday clubs</li>
                <li>societies - such as friendly societies and provident societies</li>
                <li>associations - such as housing associations and trade associations</li>
                <li>cooperatives</li>
                <li>other unincorporated associations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The taxable profits - or surpluses - of these organisations are subject to Corporation Tax.</p>
            <p>If your unincorporated organisation is liable for Corporation Tax, it's normally subject to Corporation Tax deadlines and requirements.</p>

            <h3>Unincorporated organisations with small tax liabilities</h3>
            <p>HMRC may treat some clubs and unincorporated organisations with very small tax liabilities - collectively known to HMRC as 'small clubs' - as dormant for Corporation Tax purposes.</p>
            <p>To qualify, both of the following must apply:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>your organisation's annual Corporation Tax liability must not be expected to exceed &pound;100</li>
                <li>you run your club or organisation exclusively for the benefit of its members</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If both these statements apply, HMRC will not send you a 'Notice to deliver a Company Tax Return' and will treat your organisation as dormant. They will review this at least every five years.</p>
            <p>Read about dormant and active companies and organisations in our guide <a href="layer7430.html?topicId=1082156960" title="Active/trading and dormant/not trading explained for Corporation Tax: advice for new and existing companies and organisations">trading and non-trading for Corporation Tax explained</a>.</p>
            <p>Additionally, and for each year of dormancy, your club or organisation must not have any:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>allowable trading losses for which it may want to claim relief</li>
                <li>assets it is likely to dispose of, which would give rise to a chargeable gain</li>
                <li>interest or annual payments to pay out from which tax is deductible and payable to HMRC</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What organisations are not covered by this exemption?</h3>
            <p>Most clubs and unincorporated organisations with very small tax liabilities are covered by the exemption, <strong>except for</strong> the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>privately owned clubs run by the members as a commercial enterprise for personal profit</li>
                <li>housing associations or registered social landlords - as designated in the Housing Act 1986</li>
                <li>trade associations</li>
                <li>thrift funds</li>
                <li>holiday clubs</li>
                <li>friendly societies</li>
                <li>companies which are subsidiaries of - or are wholly owned by - a charity</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Property Management Companies</h3>
            <p>HMRC may apply this treatment to your property management company if - as well as meeting all the criteria laid out in the previous sections - it meets <strong>all</strong> of the following <strong>additional</strong> criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>your company's business consists of the management - on a non-profit-making basis - of a block(s) of flats or apartments for the owners, lessees or tenants of the flats or apartments</li>
                <li>your company's Articles of Association ensure that only people who have an interest in the managed property own the company's shares</li>
                <li>your company must not be entitled to receive any income from land</li>
                <li>your company cannot pay dividends or make any other distribution of profit</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But if your property management company receives service charges which it must hold on trust for its tenants, it will be liable to Income Tax on any interest that arises on that fund. In effect, your company is acting as a trustee and may be required to deliver a tax return to the relevant HMRC Trust Office.</p>
            <p>Income from service charges for UK properties that's held on trust is chargeable at the standard tax rates. For example, basic rate in the case of bank interest as trustees are not entitled to starting rate for savings income.</p>
            <p>Generally, where the income is below &pound;1,000 and taxed at source, you won't need to complete a return every year.</p>
            <h3>What to do if your organisation is treated as dormant</h3>
            <p>Most existing organisations and property management companies that meet the necessary conditions for this exemption will already be treated as dormant by HMRC. If your organisation isn't and you think it should be, contact your Corporation Tax Office.</p>
            <p>If you have already received a letter from HMRC to say your organisation is to be treated as dormant, you don't need to contact HMRC until the end of the dormancy period unless your circumstances change. But you must contact your Corporation Tax Office immediately if your organisation no longer meets any of the conditions set out in the letter or undergoes a change that may affect its tax position.</p>
            <p>If your dormant organisation is now active again, you can use from CT204 (Active company) to tell HMRC.</p>
