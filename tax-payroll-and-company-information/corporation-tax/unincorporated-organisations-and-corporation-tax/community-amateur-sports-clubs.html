            <h2>Community Amateur Sports Clubs</h2>
            <h3>What are Community Amateur Sports Clubs (CASCs)?</h3>
            <p>CASCs are sports clubs that are registered with HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC).</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/charities/casc/register.htm" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="What are the qualifying conditions for CASC status, how to register with HMRC and information about de-registration">Read about registering as a CASC on the HMRC website</a></p>
            <h3>Are CASCs liable for Corporation Tax?</h3>
            <p>Sports clubs are liable for Corporation Tax on their profits but may qualify for tax relief to reduce their Corporation Tax bill. There are also other reliefs that clubs may be able to claim.</p>
            <p>Additionally, some CASC activities are exempt from Corporation Tax, provided that the income and/or gains generated by your CASC are used only for what's known as a 'qualifying purpose'. Generally, a qualifying purpose is providing facilities for eligible sports and encouraging people to take part in them.</p>
            <p>In addition CASCs are exempt from Corporation Tax on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>turnover less than &pound;30,000</li>
                <li>income from property less than &pound;20,000</li>
                <li>any interest income</li>
                <li>any chargeable gains</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What to do if your CASC is liable for Corporation Tax</h3>
            <p>If your CASC is liable for Corporation Tax, it's normally subject to Corporation Tax deadlines and requirements. These include telling HMRC that your CASC is liable, paying any Corporation Tax due and filing a Company Tax Return on time.</p>
