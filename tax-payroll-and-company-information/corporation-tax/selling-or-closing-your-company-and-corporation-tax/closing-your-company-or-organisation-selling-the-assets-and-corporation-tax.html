            <h1>Selling or closing your company and Corporation Tax</h1>
            <h2>Closing your company or organisation, selling the assets and Corporation Tax</h2>
            <p>If your company ceases trading and you sell its assets separately for their market value - eg plant, machinery, vehicles, computers, customer list - your company will be liable to pay Corporation Tax on any chargeable gains and other profits on the disposal of these assets.</p>
            <h3>Impact on company shareholders</h3>
            <p>If you're a company shareholder and you wind up your company, or you sell the assets of your company - and then let it be struck off the Companies Register and keep the cash proceeds of the asset sale - you as an individual may be liable for Capital Gains Tax, or sometimes Income Tax. This is because you as an individual have in effect sold or disposed of your shares in the company.</p>
            <p>You would normally pay Capital Gains Tax on the increase of what would have been the value of the shares over and above their value when you got them net of - for example - any relevant Business Asset Taper Relief, other available reliefs or winding-up costs. You will pay Income Tax if the company is struck off rather than wound up unless all of the following conditions apply:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the company's debts are settled</li>
                <li>any debts due to the company are collected</li>
                <li>the amount you take is &pound;25,000 or less</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Closing your unincorporated organisation and Corporation Tax</h3>
            <p>If you close down your club, society or other unincorporated organisation and sell off its assets (such as furniture or equipment) your organisation will be liable for Corporation Tax on any chargeable gains (capital gains for Corporation Tax purposes) or other profits on the disposal of those assets. For example, if you sell some equipment for more than you paid for it.</p>
