            <h1>Starting a company or organisation and Corporation Tax </h1>
            <h2>New clubs, societies, associations and Corporation Tax</h2>
            <p>The various requirements to tell HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) that a company is liable for Corporation Tax, pay any Corporation Tax due and file a Company Tax Return online and on time also apply to members' clubs, Community Amateur Sports clubs, societies, associations and some other unincorporated bodies.</p>
            <p>If your organisation is liable for Corporation Tax you must tell HMRC. HMRC need to know some information about your organisation and this is shown on form CT41G (Clubs) (see below). You must provide this to HMRC regardless of whether you have already given it to another HMRC tax area such as PAYE, or another body such as the Charity Commission.</p>
            <p>After you tell HMRC your organisation is liable for Corporation Tax, they will send you a form CT41G (Clubs) which will contain your company's Unique Tax Reference (UTR). Please complete then return this form to your Corporation Tax Office.</p>
            <p>But HMRC does not normally ask clubs and societies with 'very small tax liabilities' (known to HMRC as 'small' clubs) to file a Company Tax Return. Subject to certain conditions, HMRC may treat your organisation as dormant for Corporation Tax purposes. If you are unclear about your club or society's Corporation Tax position, you should ask your Corporation Tax Office for advice.</p>
