            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>When paying someone for the first time there are a number of things you need before you can decide how much PAYE and National Insurance you should deduct before you pay them.</p>
            <p>There are two key pieces of information you need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>your employees tax code, each employee has a code number individual to them</li>
                <li>your employees National Insurance category letter</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You also need to decide which method you will use to calculate PAYE and National Insurance, known as payroll. This can be electronic or manual but there are significant advantages to electronic payroll management.</p>
            <p>This tool will take you through these steps and create a summary page based on your answers which will provide links to the relevant guidance you will need to pay someone for the first time.</p>
            <p>You can save your answers as you go (registration required) and there are print and email options when you have finished to allow you to keep your summary.</p>
            <p>This tool starts your journey once the worker starts with you and their first pay day approaches. If you want to check anything that may be necessary before you pay them, for example eligibility to work in the UK or employment rights, ie holiday leave, you can use one of a series of other tools <a href="detail29fc.html?itemId=1084515656&amp;type=ONEOFFPAGE" title="Links to interactive tools">in our directory</a>.</p>
