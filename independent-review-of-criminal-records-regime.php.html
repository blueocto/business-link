	<h1>Independent review of criminal records regime</h1>
	<h2>Second phase of recommendations published</h2>
	<p>The second phase of an independent review of the criminal records regime has now been completed and submitted to Ministers. The review was carried out in two phases, and the second phase of the review has made further recommendations about how information is stored and shared.</p>
	<p>Phase two of the review contains a number of recommendations for the administration of criminal records, including that more should be done to improve the sharing of criminal records information with other countries.</p>
	<p>Phase one of the review was conducted in parallel with a review of the Vetting and Barring Scheme.</p>
	<p><strong>What the review recommendations mean for employers</strong></p>
	<p>There will be no immediate changes to the way employers check an employee or volunteer's criminal record, so it remains business as usual.</p>
	<p>Some of the changes recommended by the review require legislation, and these provisions are in the Protection of Freedoms Bill which is currently going through Parliament.</p>
