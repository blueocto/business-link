        <h1>Here's how I registered and used my patent</h1>
        <h2>Here's how I registered and used my patent</h2>
        <p>After developing an innovative polyethylene zip with teeth, entrepreneur Heather Kitching set about exploiting her idea. But first she had to protect her design - and so began the process of securing a patent. Heather's hard work paid off - her idea is now used in a range of well-known packaging products and has scooped several high-profile awards.</p>
        <p><strong>What I did</strong></p>
        <h3>Understand your intended market</h3>
        <p>"In 1996 I invented the concept of the world's first polyethylene weldable zip fastener with teeth, which doesn't break under repeated use like some 'tramline'-type zips. At first the idea seemed so simple I nearly discounted it, but it soon became clear that it had potentially successful commercial possibilities - and I'd need patent protection to make the most of these possibilities.</p>
        <p>"While I wanted to protect the idea as soon as possible I held off lodging my application while I researched the market. Having discovered several market opportunities I was able to improve my patent outline. Armed with a clear, detailed idea I contacted the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys who put me in touch with a local solicitor who is registered with the professional body as a patent attorney. Doing so ensured I would be working with someone with credibility and confidentiality. Ultimately I talked to four attorneys before choosing one."</p>
        <h3>Prepare the application</h3>
        <p>"The first step was to draw up a specification for the idea from which I could finalise my patent application. I spent a lot of time and money getting this right and used a professional draughtsman to get my conceptual drawings spot-on.</p>
        <p>"I was then ready to submit the first part of my patent application, known as the 'abstract'. Essentially this outlines how my idea solves a problem. The second part of the application was to prepare my 'claims'. These form the skeleton of your idea and they explain in simple terms what your idea actually is. It is important to include as many of these as you can, so that your idea is as specific as possible and isn't vulnerable to being copied. While all of this was being done my patent attorney carried out searches at the UK Intellectual Property Office to check that my idea hadn't been done before. Once this was done I submitted my complete patent application."</p>
        <h3>Capitalise on the patent</h3>
        <p>"Patent applications take a few years to be approved so during this time I turned my attention to developing the idea and finding companies that could turn the idea into commercial products. But in order to do this I had to brush up on my sales and marketing skills. Eventually, after a couple of years the patent was approved and, armed with prototypes, I licensed the technology to a major packaging company. Unfortunately this venture was unsuccessful after the licensee was found in breach of the agreement. Having secured the patent, it was easier for me to get the licensee to stop using the idea when we brought the agreement to a close.</p>
        <p>"Since then I've followed a different approach by setting up my own company - Reuzip - with my husband to handle the distribution and production of the merchandise. We now supply major supermarkets such as Sainsbury's with our unique products and in 2000 I scooped the Tomorrow's World Entrepreneur of the Year Award and the Best British Invention - the first woman to win this award."</p>
        <p><strong>What I'd do differently</strong></p>
        <h3>Spread the risk</h3>
        <p>"I would avoid the temptation of putting all my eggs in one basket by signing up with just one licensee. Our one licensee took a long time to utilise the product - and ultimately abused the agreement - which ended up losing me valuable time and money."</p>
