			<h1>Provide training and information</h1>

			<p>Everyone who works for you needs to know how to work safely and without risks to health. You must provide clear instructions, information and adequate training for your employees.</p>
			<p>Don't forget contractors and self-employed people who may be working for you and make sure everyone has information on:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>hazards and risks they may face</li>
				<li>measures in place to deal with those hazards and risks</li>
				<li>how to follow any emergency procedures</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Ask your employees what they think about training to make sure it's relevant and effective. Keeping training records will help you to identify when refresher training might be needed.</p>
			<p>The information and training you provide should be in a form that is easy to understand. Everyone working for you should know what they are expected to do.</p>
			<p>Health and safety training should take place during working hours and it must not be paid for by employees. There are many external trainers who will be able to help you with your training needs but effective training can often be done 'in house'.</p>
			<p>Remember some of your staff may have particular training needs, for example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>new recruits</li>
				<li>people changing jobs or taking on extra responsibilities</li>
				<li>young employees, who are particularly vulnerable to accidents - <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/youngpeople/index.htm" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Advice on the training needs for young workers">read about the key risks and health and safety factors you need to consider for young people at work on the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) website</a></li>
				<li>health and safety representatives - <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/involvement/training.htm" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Advice on training needs and providers for both union and non-union health and safety representatives">read about training for health and safety representatives on the HSE website</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Remember that staff will need extra training if you get new equipment or working practices change.</p>
			<p>To find out more, <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg345.pdf" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Why health and safety training is important to your business">download the guidance leaflet on providing training and information from the HSE website (PDF, 113K)</a>.</p>
			<p>This leaflet provides further help for readers including how to undertake training and choosing appropriate methods and organisations to help deliver the training.</p>
