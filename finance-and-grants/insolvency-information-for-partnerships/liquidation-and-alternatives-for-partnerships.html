			<h1>Liquidation and alternatives for partnerships</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>When two or more people form a partnership to carry on a business, the individuals of that partnership are personally responsible for the debts of that business. Partnerships can be wound up if they cannot pay the money they owe to creditors and the individual partners can be declared bankrupt. However, this does not guarantee that creditors of a business will get their money back.</p>
			<p>The Insolvency Service is the government agency responsible for investigating financial failure and misconduct of individuals and companies. Through the office of the official receiver, the Insolvency Service finds out how and why an individual became bankrupt or a company went into compulsory liquidation. The Insolvency Service can also provide general information on insolvency and redundancy matters.</p>
			<p>This guide is for creditors of partnerships and anyone in a partnership. It explains the standard processes for winding up a partnership. It also gives information on how to put a partnership into liquidation - with or without making the individual partners bankrupt.</p>
