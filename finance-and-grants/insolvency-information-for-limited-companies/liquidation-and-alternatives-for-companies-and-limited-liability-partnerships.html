			<h1>Liquidation and alternatives for companies and limited liability partnerships</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Liquidation is the process of bringing the business activities of a company or limited liability partnership (LLP) to an end. There are two types of liquidation - voluntary and compulsory. Voluntary liquidation is when a company or LLP decides to close, while compulsory liquidation occurs if the court issues a winding-up order.</p>
			<p>When liquidation takes place, a company or LLP stops trading and an insolvency specialist - or liquidator - is appointed. In voluntary liquidations, the liquidator is always an insolvency practitioner (IP) from the private sector.</p>
			<p>In compulsory liquidations, the liquidator can be either an IP - where the company or LLP has assets - or a government official called the official receiver (OR). They have the power to take control of the company or LLP and sell off its assets - if there are any - to obtain money. After paying the costs of the liquidation, the remaining money - if there is any - is used to pay off debts.</p>
			<p>The OR works for The Insolvency Service, the government agency responsible for investigating the financial failure and misconduct of individuals and companies. Through its OR offices, The Insolvency Service finds out how and why an individual became bankrupt or a company or LLP went into compulsory liquidation.</p>
			<p>This guide explains how a company or LLP can be liquidated, and the consequences of going into liquidation. It also explains the rules that apply to receivers, corporate voluntary arrangements and administrations. Finally, this guide gives detailed information about liquidation and insolvency documents that must be filed with the Registrar of Companies at Companies House.</p>
