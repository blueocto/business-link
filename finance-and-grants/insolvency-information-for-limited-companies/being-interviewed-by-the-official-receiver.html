			<h1>Being interviewed by the official receiver</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>If you are facing bankruptcy or your company is facing compulsory liquidation, one of the first things you will experience is the official receiver (OR) interview. The OR is both an officer of the court and a civil servant from The Insolvency Service, the government agency responsible for dealing with financial failure and misconduct. ORs' offices are found throughout England and Wales and cover the High Court and county courts. </p>
			<p>The court notifies the OR if you have been declared bankrupt for personal debts, including debts incurred as a sole trader or when trading in partnership with someone else, or if your company has been put into compulsory liquidation by the courts. The OR is then responsible for protecting any assets and investigating the causes of the bankruptcy or compulsory liquidation. As there are only 35 ORs in England and Wales, your bankruptcy or company liquidation will be handled by a member of staff who works within your local OR's office. You will be interviewed by the OR. </p>
			<p>This guide explains the process and timescales of the interview with your OR. It will guide you through what happens before, during and after the interview process and how you can make the best of the process.</p>
