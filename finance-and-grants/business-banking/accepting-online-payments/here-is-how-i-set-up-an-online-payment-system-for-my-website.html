			<h1>Here's how I set up an online payment system for my website</h1>
			<h2>Here's how I set up an online payment system for my website</h2>
			<p>Foska.com is an online retailer of cycle clothing. Established two years ago as a subsidiary of a chain of high street retail outlets, the company employs 30 people. Director Tony Yerby describes how foska.com enabled its website to accept online payments from customers.</p>
			<p><strong>What I did</strong></p>
			<h3>Get a merchant account</h3>
			<p>"When we set up the website, we wanted to accept online payments from day one. We already had a merchant account for accepting cards in our high street outlets, so it made sense to extend that to the website, rather than outsourcing the whole process to a payment processing company.</p>
			<p>"We got a separate account with our existing credit card service provider who created an account for us with their online payment processing service called ePDQ. Because we'd already undergone the relevant checks, the process was quite simple."</p>
			<h3>Integrate the system</h3>
			<p>"When a customer pays by card, the money ends up in a merchant account, which needs to be linked to your website via encryption software. The integration looked complicated, so we used a specialist to do this.</p>
			<p>"They helped us install a system comprising an e-commerce shop window, linked to ePDQ via secure-form hosting software. This had the added benefit of allowing us to brand the site more effectively and make it more customer friendly. The two software packages we bought were off-the-shelf, although our consultant ensured they were both compatible with each other and with ePDQ."</p>
			<h3>Address security issues</h3>
			<p>"Using trusted providers helps minimise the risks of fraud, but it doesn't eliminate them. Because online transactions are card-not-present, if a payment proves to be fraudulent, the missing cash is deducted from your account by your card service provider.</p>
			<p>"Our system has various security checks and controls that we can turn on and off. It's tempting to go for the highest level of checking, but we soon realised that this rejects many valid orders - where the customer gets their postcode wrong, for example. It's important not to let the technology take over from common sense. Our software also provides detailed reporting, including losses incurred through fraud. We monitor the figures regularly to identify any particular areas for concern."</p>
			<p><strong>What I'd do differently</strong></p>
			<h3>Start with an off-the-shelf package</h3>
			<p>"Before we brought in an IT consultant, we had started to build an online store by hiring a company to design a bespoke solution. We ended up scrapping it because it was difficult to integrate. With the benefit of hindsight, we should have gone for existing software from the start."</p>
