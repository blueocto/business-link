			<h1>Foreign currency and exchange risks</h1>
			<h2>Identify foreign exchange risks</h2>
			<p>When your business deals in a foreign currency you are exposed to certain risks.</p>
			<p>For example, you might find that after agreeing a price for exported or imported goods the <strong>exchange rate changes</strong> before delivery. Clearly, this can work both for and against you.</p>
			<p>Some currencies are more volatile than others because of their unstable economies or inflation. However, the current economic climate is also impacting more stable currencies such as the euro and the US dollar. Your bank should be able to advise you about this.</p>
			<p>As exchange rates can go both up and down, it can be tempting to gamble that this will work out in your favour. However, this is extremely risky and could land you with a significant financial loss.</p>
			<p>It's safer to reduce the risk by using one of the forms of hedging available through a bank. <strong>Hedging</strong> simply means insuring against the price of currency moving against you in the future. There are many different types of currency hedging and your bank should be able to help you with the best solutions for your business. Two types of hedging are discussed in this guide - see the pages in this guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/business-banking/foreign-currency-and-exchange-risks/forward-foreign-exchange-contracts.php" title="When it's a good idea to agree to buy or sell a fixed amount of foreign currency on a set date">forward foreign exchange contracts</a>, and <a href="/finance-and-grants/business-banking/foreign-currency-and-exchange-risks/buying-currency-options.php" title="The pros and cons of buying currency options and how it might help your business hedge foreign exchange risks">buying currency options</a>. You may also consider opening a foreign currency account - see the pages in this guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/business-banking/foreign-currency-and-exchange-risks/banking-overseas-and-uk-based-foreign-currency-accounts.php" title="Pros and cons of opening an overseas bank account or a UK-based foreign currency account to hedge your risks ">banking overseas and UK-based foreign currency accounts</a>.</p>
			<p>You could <strong>trade overseas in sterling</strong> - effectively transferring the foreign exchange risk to the business you're dealing with. Whether this is appropriate will depend on the product in question and the relative bargaining strength of you and your trading partner.</p>
			<p>Bear in mind that exchange rates could have an effect on your business' competitiveness even if you don't trade overseas. When a country's currency loses value against the pound, imports from that country into the UK become cheaper, so you may have to respond to aggressive pricing from competitors who source from that country.</p>
			<p>Similarly, if a country's currency gains value against sterling, UK exports to that country become cheaper.</p>
