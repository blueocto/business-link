			<h1>Foreign currency and exchange risks</h1>
			<h2>Foreign currency issues when importing or exporting</h2>
			<p>Businesses which import or export goods need to bear in mind a number of key issues when making transactions in foreign currencies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Foreign currency transactions are sensitive to fluctuations in the exchange rate. A price you agree with a customer or supplier on one day could rise or fall if the exchange rate changes. This is especially true in the current economic climate where currency is fluctuating on a daily basis making it more difficult to keep track of exchange rates. But there are steps you can take to protect yourself against these. See the page in this guide on how to <a href="/finance-and-grants/business-banking/foreign-currency-and-exchange-risks/identify-foreign-exchange-risks.php" title="Assessing the possible impact of exchange rate changes - and what you can do to minimise the risks">identify foreign exchange risks</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you're exporting, you must decide whether it's best to price your goods or services in the local currency of the country with which you're trading. The decision will depend on individual circumstances and on factors such as how you want to present yourself in that market and how your competitors set their prices.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you're importing components priced in a foreign currency that form part of goods you're selling in sterling, you'll need to decide how to price those goods to reflect the exchange rate.
				</li>
				<li>If you are trading with companies in the eurozone (ie the European Union member states that use the euro) there are many practices and standards to make life easier. See our guide on <a href="layer653b.html?topicId=1074415241" title="How to take advantage of the freeing up of trade between countries in the European Union">trading in the European Union</a>.</li>
