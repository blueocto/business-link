			<h1>Debit and credit cards for your business</h1>
			<h2>Choosing a card provider</h2>
			<p>When you have decided which type of business payment card you're looking for, how do you choose the right card provider?</p>
			<p><strong>Debit card</strong> choices are the most straightforward. Your business bank account is most likely to offer a debit card free as part of the package.</p>
			<p>However, for other types of card it's worth considering a range of providers as well as your own bank.</p>
			<p><strong>Business charge cards</strong> are offered by most business banks and companies such as Barclaycard, American Express and Diners Club. It's worth examining the different deals available and considering a number of key points:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Is there an annual fee? If so, how much and is it payable for each cardholder?</li>
				<li>Can you give individual cards to chosen employees?</li>
				<li>What are the minimum and maximum spending limits?</li>
				<li>What are the penalties for late payment of your bill?</li>
				<li>Are there any added perks or benefits - perhaps Air Miles or hotel discounts - that would be useful to your business?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The same considerations generally apply if you're choosing a <b>credit card</b> for your business. But here it's essential to compare the interest rate - usually expressed as the APR (annual percentage rate) - of different deals. The length of any interest-free period is also an important consideration.

			<p>Whichever type of card you are looking for, it is advisable to shop around and negotiate. Interest rates, charges, interest-free periods and benefits can vary significantly. Your bank account provider may be prepared to amend its terms if you can demonstrate that another provider offers a better deal.</p>
			<p>To find out about the deals on offer, go into local bank branches or visit the websites of banks with small-business accounts. <a href="https://moneyfacts.co.uk/business/" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Find the most competitive business current accounts, deposit accounts and commercial mortgages">Compare business bank accounts on the Moneyfacts website</a>.</p>
