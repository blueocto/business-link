			<h1>Debit and credit cards for your business</h1>
			<h2>Types of card available</h2>
			<p>There's a wide range of plastic payment cards on the market, offering an array of different terms and conditions and ways to pay off your balance.</p>
			<p>Credit cards:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>allow purchases up to a specified limit</li>
				<li>offer an interest-free period</li>
				<li>allow a minimum repayment each month, but charge interest on the balance</li>
				<li>incur no interest if the bill is paid in full by the specified date</li>
				<li>can be issued to employees, with an approved spending limit</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are numerous credit card providers - most are Visa or MasterCards issued through a bank or building society.</p>
			<p>You can:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="https://www.visa.co.uk/for-business/accepting-visa" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Search for a Visa card provider in your country">read about Visa credit cards on the Visa website</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://www.mastercard.co.uk/content/mccom/en-gb/issuers.html/" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk">find out about MasterCard credit cards on the MasterCard website</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Charge cards:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>allow a period of credit - but must be paid off in full each month</li>
				<li>can be issued to employees</li>
				<li>allow you to set spending limits</li>
				<li>may charge an annual fee</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Debit cards:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>are issued in conjunction with a business current account</li>
				<li>might be cheaper than cheques</li>
				<li>can only be used by signatories</li>
				<li>may offer a greater degree of control - you can only spend what's in your account</li>
				<li>have less flexibility than other cards</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Pre-paid cards:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>enable businesses to manage and monitor spending</li>
				<li>can be provided pre-loaded to employees to pay expenses</li>
				<li>are available in different currencies as an alternative to travel cards</li>
				<li>usually come with fees and charges - such as issuing costs, management fees, and transaction or ATM withdrawal fees</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Travel cards:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>offer a convenient way of paying business travel expenses when travelling</li>
				<li>operate in the same way as other business credit or charge cards</li>
				<li>offer additional benefits, such as travel insurance or currency facilities</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Purchasing cards:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>are generally restricted to big businesses or public-sector bodies</li>
				<li>are issued by banks and companies such as Barclaycard and American Express</li>
				<li>cut down on paperwork and the need for purchase orders</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You could use a personal debit or credit card instead of a business card for business expenses, eg while you wait for your business bank account to be set up. However this means you will be mixing personal debts with business debts.</p>
			<p>It also makes it more difficult to track business expenditure.
