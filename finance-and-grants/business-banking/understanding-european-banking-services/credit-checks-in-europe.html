			<h1>Understanding European banking services</h1>
			<h2>Credit checks in Europe</h2>
			<p>Europe does not currently have as extensive a credit checking system as the UK. Credit applications are reviewed and decisions are commonly based on:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>salary</li>
				<li>current debts</li>
				<li>family situation</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, if you or a director of your company holds an account and runs up bad credit, then a bank will put you in a special file which is shared by all lending institutions. For example, in France you become interdit bancaire (forbidden to bank) and will not be able to get a loan anywhere else.</p>
			<p>In the Netherlands, a bank will often check the credit history of individual applicants or company directors and may register new foreign clients with the Central Credit Registration office or 'Bureau Kredietregistratie' (BKR). If a person has a bad debt record they will be registered with BKR.</p>
			<h3>Recent developments</h3>
			<p>There have been recent developments to create a common credit market across Europe and maintain high levels of consumer protection.</p>
			<p>The Consumer Credit Directive Directive (CCD) came into force as law on 1 February 2011 and any credit agreement signed after this date must comply with the regulations.</p>
			<p>The CCD will affect your business if it involves lending money, or making credit available to consumers, or acting on behalf of consumers or lenders in relation to prospective credit agreements. You can <a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/r/10-1072-consumer-credit-directive-quick-guide.pdf" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Introductory guidance to consumers rights when entering credit agreements">download a guide to CCD regulations from the Business, Innovation &amp; Skills website (PDF, 67K)</a>.</p>
			<p>In June 2009, the European Commission published a report by the Expert Group on Credit Histories (EGCH), identifying solutions to improve the access to, and exchange of, consumers' credit data within the European Union (EU).</p>
			<p>The EGCH rejected the proposal for the creation of a single pan-European <strong>credit register</strong>, which would align the credit histories of all EU member states within one central register as an unrealistic and ineffective option.</p>
			<p>Instead, the EGCH proposed that:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>credit checks be accessible throughout the credit lifecycle, even after the credit agreement has expired</li>
				<li>the CCD be used to ensure foreign creditors get the same level of access to credit data as local creditors</li>
				<li>national data protection authorities work towards more harmonisation to facilitate the process of cross-border credit data exchange</li>
				<li>the use of data across borders should comply with the national rules of the country from where it is accessed</li>
			</ul>

			<p>At present, there are national central credit registers (CCRs) in 14 EU countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia and Spain.</p>
			<p>These CCRs are operated by central banks and their role is to collect information on debt from reporting institutions. This information allows credit risk to be accurately assessed, especially when it is supported by additional information from other national CCRs.<br />
