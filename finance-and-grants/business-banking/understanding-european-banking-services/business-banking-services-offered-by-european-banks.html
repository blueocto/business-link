			<h1>Understanding European banking services</h1>
			<h2>Business banking services offered by European banks</h2>
			<p>The type of bank account you will need to run your business in Europe will depend on how your business is structured. Banks may offer different services depending on whether you are setting up as a sole trader, limited liability company, partnership, subsidiary office or not-for-profit company.</p>
			<p>Many countries in Europe offer a similar range of services to those available in the UK, including internet banking, electronic payment services, ATMs, credit and debit cards, and business advice services.</p>
			<p>When choosing a bank, you should consider:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>location - is it close to your business?</li>
				<li>fees - are you charged by the bank for the services you use most?</li>
				<li>level of customer service</li>
				<li>whether the bank insures the money you deposit</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Services and fees</h3>
			<p>What you pay to operate a business bank account depends on the services you select. For example, you may reduce the fees charged if you choose to run your bank account only by telephone or internet. However, if you prefer your account to be managed by a branch manager or business adviser, and to receive regular printed statements, you are likely to be charged for these services.</p>
			<h3>Cheques and overdrafts</h3>
			<p>In many countries in Europe, cheques are rarely used, except for some business payments. In some European countries, it is illegal to make cheque payments unless there are sufficient funds in your account to cover the transaction. This is because banks tend to be less lenient than UK banks with regard to unauthorised overdrafts. In France, for example, it is illegal to be overdrawn without authorisation and you can be barred from holding a bank account if you do not stay in credit.</p>
			<p>The cheque guarantee system (using a cheque card, for example) does not exist in most countries in Europe, so you may be asked for proof of identity if you make a payment by cheque.</p>
			<h3>Non eurozone banks</h3>
			<p>The eurozone - or 'euro area' - covers European Union (EU) member states which have adopted the euro currency as their sole legal tender.</p>
			<p>Business banking in non-eurozone countries - eg the Baltic countries Latvia and Lithuania - is dominated by Scandinavian banks. However, domestic banks in these countries are developing rapidly and taking market share. The Baltic currencies are pegged to the euro, so it is possible to hold euro-denominated bank accounts or to exchange between euros and local currency for a relatively small charge. Estonia adopted the euro in January 2011.</p>
