			<h1>Understanding European banking services</h1>
			<h2>What you will need to set up your business account in Europe</h2>
			<p>If you are a business based in the UK and want to set up a business account in Europe, there are different requirements depending on the type of business you run and the country in which you want to open the account.</p>
			<h3>Limited liability companies</h3>
			<p>If you are setting up a limited liability company in Europe, most banks will require you to deposit a proportion of your company's paid-up capital - share capital that your company has issued and received payment for - in a business account in that country in order for you to register your business as a legal entity there.</p>
			<p>In some countries the standard proportion of capital is 25 per cent, but in others - eg Latvia - the full amount of <strong>authorised capital</strong> - ie the amount of share capital that the company is authorised by its articles of association to issue to shareholders - must be deposited with the bank.</p>
			<p>The account in which that money is held is usually blocked until the company is formally registered by the relevant authorities. In some countries the banks make a commission charge to accept the deposit and issue a certificate to state that the funds have been placed with them.</p>
			<p>To register your company formally, you need to obtain an official identification number from the relevant company registration authority.</p>
			<p>You will use the company registration number in most of the company's correspondence with official authorities - eg taxation services, enterprise agencies, employment authorities. To obtain it you will need proof of identity, your company's statutory documents (or articles of association) and name and information on the company's activity.</p>
			<p>You can <a href="http://www.rba.co.uk/sources/registers.htm" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Details of company registration authorities in Europe">find details of where to register your company in different European countries on the Official Company Registers website</a>.</p>
			<h3>Opening a business account</h3>
			<p>You can open a bank account in any member state of the EU according to that country's rules. Banking rules in the EU are not harmonised and requirements vary from country to country.</p>
			<p>As with UK banks, a bank's terms and conditions can also vary according to the type of account opened. You should check that the bank and account offer the services you require and that you understand the terms, conditions and charges.</p>
			<p>To open a business bank account in an EU member state, you are commonly required to provide a number of documents, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>proof of identification</li>
				<li>proof of residence</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, different countries will require different documents. Some banks may even require references and credit checks.</p>
			<p>As an example, to open a business bank account in France, you will need:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>proof of identity and residence</li>
				<li>a copy of your company articles</li>
				<li>a copy of the company's Extrait K-bis - the certificate provided when you registered with the Registre du commerce et des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In France, a transaction fee and quarterly account fee is charged on business accounts.</p>
