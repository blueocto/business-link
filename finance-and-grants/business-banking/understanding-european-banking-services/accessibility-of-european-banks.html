			<h1>Understanding European banking services</h1>
			<h2>Accessibility of European banks</h2>
			<p>If you are a business based in the UK seeking banking services in Europe, most banks in Europe offer remote telephone, online banking services and ATM cash withdrawals. Standing orders, direct debits and electronic transfers are also available.</p>
			<h3>Bank branches</h3>
			<p>In many countries the branch network and contact with customers at branch level is still important in business banking. It is important to maintain a good relationship with your customer manager. They are there to deal with all your queries about the day-to-day running of your business account. If you keep them up to date with your activities, they will be able to respond more swiftly when you require help from your bank.</p>
			<p>For example, if you need a business loan in France, the charg&eacute; de client&egrave;le - who manages your account at a local branch - will make an initial assessment of your request for finance. The final decision on whether to lend the money is taken by a lending committee on the advice of your charg&eacute; de client&egrave;le.</p>
			<h3>Debit and credit cards</h3>
			<p>The use of debit and credit cards is common in many countries and debit cards are provided by many national banks. Facilities such as Cirrus and Maestro are also widely available.</p>
			<p>In Europe, credit cards are dominated by the major American providers and most banks offer them as part of their service. But with Europe quickly adopting Chip and PIN to help prevent fraud and the European Payments Council announcing a potential ban on magnetic stripe cards, any credit card with a magnetic stripe could soon be worthless.</p>
			<h3>Opening hours</h3>
			<p>Bank opening hours vary from country to country. Most are open between 09.00 and 17.00 from Monday to Friday, though some open as early as 08.00 and close at 15.00. Often the size of a town will determine the opening times of a bank branch.</p>
			<p>In some countries and especially outside large cities, banks may close over lunch time. In some countries banks do not open at all at weekends, while in others you will find that some banks open on Saturday morning.</p>
			<p>As an example, in Germany banks open from 08.30 or 09.00 until 16.00. On Wednesdays smaller branches are often closed, and larger banks may close at 13.00. In Germany, banks frequently stay open until 18.30 on Thursdays.</p>
