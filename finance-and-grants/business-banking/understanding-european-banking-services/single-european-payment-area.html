			<h1>Understanding European banking services</h1>
			<h2>Single European Payment Area</h2>
			<p>The Single European Payment Area (SEPA) initiative is part of the move towards European integration, made possible by the introduction of the single currency.</p>
			<p>SEPA allows private individuals and business customers to make non-cash payments in euros - eg by credit or debit card, bank transfer or direct debit - to any beneficiary in the eurozone. Another aim of SEPA is to harmonise technical standards used for plastic cards throughout Europe, simplifying the process for retailers.</p>
			<p>SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) means there is no longer any difference between domestic and international payments. For sums of up to &euro;50,000 paid into a bank account within the European Union (EU), no bank commission should be payable as long as the bank subscribes to the SEPA initiative. An SCT will be made within a maximum of three days, and without any deductions from the principal amount.</p>
			<p>SEPA can offer businesses many facilities, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>accepting payment cards from all SEPA countries</li>
				<li>simplified financial processing</li>
				<li>a single bank account to cover all of Europe</li>
				<li>faster settlement - standardised</li>
				<li>improved cash flow</li>
				<li>reduced costs</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A number of UK-based banks have committed to joining the SCT scheme and account for about 85 per cent of the UK payments market. By October 2010, 9.6 per cent of all credits transfers in the euro area were processed in the SCT format.</p>
			<h3>Banking costs under SEPA</h3>
			<p>The development of SEPA will mean lower banking costs due to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>increased efficiency</li>
				<li>open market competition</li>
				<li>lower operational costs</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Even though some banks may face increased costs to implement the initiative, the competitive market under SEPA will prevent them from passing this cost on to customers.</p>
			<p>All UK residents - private individuals and businesses - will still benefit from SEPA even though there may be a delay in payment due to the need for currency conversion.</p>
			<p>SEPA was devised by the European Central Bank and introduced under the European Commission Payment Services Directive.</p>
			<h3>The future of SEPA</h3>
			<p>The SEPA initiative began in 2006 and currently comprises the 27 EU Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Monaco. Most major banks in the EU are involved. Banks have been able to use SEPA payment instruments since January 2008.</p>
			<p>Because of the variety of national cashless payment systems, there is still a lot of work to be done to transfer all existing national systems to SEPA. At this moment, SEPA is mainly limited to cross-border transactions.</p>
			<p>Every country has established a national forum to deal with their individual needs for dealing with SEPA. Plans have also been drafted by each nation to outline the measures necessary to transfer to SEPA. <a href="http://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/sepa/pdf/SEPA_community_fora_201107.pdf?45832efd0f757fec0c2283dabdfaac51" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Individual national forums, migration plans and reports, and other links regarding SEPA">Download an overview of national SEPA strategies from the European Central Bank website (PDF, 151.8K)</a> </p>
