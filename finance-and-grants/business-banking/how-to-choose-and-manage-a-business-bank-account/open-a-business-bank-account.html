			<ul>
				<li>details of your business and business activities.</li>
				<li>where the start-up finance for the business has come from - eg from you, other investors or from a</li>
				<li>a business plan - see our guides on how to <a href="layer5019.html?topicId=1073869162" title="The essential role that creating and using a business plan plays in starting a successful new business">prepare a business plan</a> and how to <a href="layer2852.html?topicId=1073958998" title="How to present your business plan to the right people in order to secure funding">use your business plan to get funding</a></li>
				<li>information on your credit history</li>
				<li>bank statements for the business if you already have a business account</li>

			<p>You will also have to provide the following information and documents:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A driving licence, passport or other acceptable form of ID.</li>
				<li>Proof of address, such as a recent utility bill for you and for any other person involved in the management of the business. If you are a limited company, this information will have to be provided for any directors and company secretaries so that the bank can check your identity as required under money laundering laws.</li>
				<li>An account opening mandate. The bank will give you this.</li>
				<li>A list of the persons who can sign on the bank account and a sample of their signature. The bank will ask you to specify in what combination people will sign on the account. For example, cheques may require two signatures.<br />
