			<h1>How to choose and manage a business bank account</h1>
			<h2>Manage a business account</h2>
			<p>As your business grows and changes, you may find that the terms and conditions attached to your business bank account are no longer best for your business. It is important to regularly review the situation so that if this is the case, you can switch to a different account or negotiate to change the terms and conditions of your current account.</p>
			<p>It is important to build up a good relationship with your bank. You should always try to keep to the terms and conditions attached to each of your business accounts, so it is better to change the conditions of your account rather than breach an agreed term - eg exceeding a credit limit, which would incur extra fees and could give you a bad credit rating.</p>
			<p>You should be especially careful not to allow the business account to become overdrawn - unless an overdraft limit has been agreed - or to exceed any overdraft limit without prior agreement.</p>
			<p>Your relationship with your bank will also be improved if they understand your business. You can help them to improve their understanding by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>talking to the person managing your account on a regular basis</li>
				<li>sending your accounts to the bank every year, if requested</li>
				<li>providing the bank with updated copies of your business plan when you need new loans or increased overdraft facilities - see our guide on how to <a href="layer2852.html?topicId=1073958998" title="How to present your business plan to the right people in order to secure funding">use your business plan to get funding</a></li>
				<li>letting your bank know if you plan any unusual transactions - eg significant capital expenditure</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You should always notify the bank immediately of any problems your business may be experiencing.</p>
			<p>If you are unhappy with any aspect of the service you have received from your bank, in the first instance complain to your bank. If you remain unhappy, you can <a href="http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Follow the steps to make a complaint direct to a company before contacting the Financial Ombudsman
">find details about complaining or resolving a dispute with your bank on the Financial Ombudsman website</a>. However, please note that the ombudsman is only able to assist small businesses with an annual turnover of less than &euro;2 million and fewer than ten employees.</p>
			<p>Beyond maintaining a good relationship with your bank, you can also manage your bank account more easily by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ensuring only appropriate persons are authorised to make payments from the bank account</li>
				<li>keeping <strong>records</strong> of all transactions in the bank account</li>
				<li>keeping and checking through your bank <strong>statements</strong></li>
				<li>using your bank statements to check the financial position of the business</li>
				<li>cross-checking your statements with your business records to ensure that all transactions are correct</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Online banking can make it quick and easy to check balances and payments.
