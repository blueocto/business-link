	<h1>How to choose and manage a business bank account</h1>
	<h2>Choosing a business bank account</h2>
	<p>The type of account/s you choose will depend on your business' needs. For example, if you make frequent transactions, a fixed-fee account may be more cost effective than one that charges per transaction. Some accounts also allow free direct debits or standing orders.</p>
	<p>Depending on your business, you may require:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>a <strong>business current account</strong> for daily transactions, payments and receipts - eg one that pays interest on credit balances (though not all banks offer this)</li>
		<li>an <strong>instant access deposit account</strong> for cash sums not needed for daily operations but can be accessed as required</li>
		<li>a <strong>term deposit account</strong> for funds not needed immediately or at short notice</li>
		<li>a <strong>foreign currency account</strong> if you trade overseas and if you receive and make payments in foreign currency</li>
		<li>a<strong> loan account</strong> for any loans you take out</li>
		<li>a <strong>merchant account</strong> to accept and process debit and credit card transactions - see our guides on <a href="layer6f41.html?topicId=1074407140" title="Advice on using payment cards for business expenditure and on increasing sales by accepting cards from customers">using payment cards to buy and sell goods or services</a> and <a href="layer66a6.html?topicId=1073920405" title="How online payments work and how to set up a payment facility">accepting online payments</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Before choosing a business account, you should compare the different services and costs. For example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>facilities - eg automatic money transfers, debit and credit cards or telephone or internet banking</li>
		<li>interest rates - particularly if you're usually in credit</li>
		<li>overdraft charges - particularly if you're often overdrawn</li>
		<li>monthly fees</li>
		<li>additional account charges - eg for statements, cheques and cash payments</li>
		<li>additional services - eg small-business advice</li>
	</ul>
	<p><a href="http://www.bba.org.uk/media/article/business-account-finder" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Information about business bank account providers in the UK
">Compare business bank accounts on the British Bankers' Association (BBA) website</a>.</p>
	<h3>Improving your current deal</h3>
	<p>You should review your bank accounts at least once a year and compare them with others available.</p>
	<p>If you compare your current bank's service with others on the market you will know how competitive your deal is, or if there are better options. But you don't have to switch banks to improve your deal, you could instead see if you can agree better terms with your existing bank. If you have a history as a good customer, your bank may be willing to negotiate with you.</p>
	<p>You should meet with your bank to explain how your current deal could be improved, highlighting some better deals offered by other banks. You could ask them to amend the terms of your account - eg changing specific charges or interest rates on a loan or overdraft - before you take your business elsewhere.</p>
	<p>If successful, you could improve the terms of your account and avoid the disruption of switching banks.</p>
	<p>If you do decide to transfer your bank account, you should aim to make your business as appealing as possible to a new provider. For more information, see the page on <a href="detail1733.html?itemId=1097372617&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="Banks have a number of core criteria which they will take into account in assessing your finance application">what banks look for in a business</a> in our guide on <a href="layer596f.html?topicId=1087443478" title="Making sure your business is ready to apply for funding will help if you are seeking additional finance">obtaining bank finance</a>.</p>
	<h3>Using more than one bank</h3>
	<p>You could also consider using different banks to fulfil different financial requirements. This allows you to pick and choose the most beneficial parts of various deals - eg a bank offering competitive interest rates on current account balances may not offer attractive loan rates. It also lets you build links with several different banks or financial providers, making it easier to switch accounts in the future.</p>
	<p>However, it may also be more complicated and time consuming to keep track of your financial affairs and to build a relationship with each bank. A bank may also offer better terms if you commit all your business to it.</p>
