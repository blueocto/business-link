			<h1>How to choose and manage a business bank account</h1>
			<h2>How to switch banks</h2>
			<p>Changing the bank your business uses can be time-consuming and disruptive.</p>
			<p>However, subscribers to the Banking Conduct of Business Sourcebook (BCOBS) - which replaced the Business Banking Code on 1 November 2009 - have committed to making the transfer of bank accounts quicker and simpler for customers. <a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/BCOBS/" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="The Banking Conduct of Business Sourcebook">Find BCOBS on the Financial Services Authority (FSA) website</a> and <a href="http://www.bba.org.uk/media/article/industry-guidance-for-fsa-banking-conduct-of-business-sourcebook" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Read information on the new rules and best practice standards">read industry guidance about BCOBS on the British Bankers' Association (BBA) website</a>.</p>
			<p>Under BCOBS, your old bank must send your direct debit and standing order details to you and your new bank within three days of any request. Your new bank must then set up these payments and inform the recipients of your direct debits within four working days.</p>
			<p>If you are changing banks, you can ensure the process runs smoothly by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Contacting your new bank and obtaining application forms in advance. Check the terms and conditions of your new account carefully and discuss any concerns before returning the forms.</li>
				<li>Having business information ready for your new bank - eg who will have access to the account.</li>
				<li>Completing the mandate from your new bank to allow them to deal with your old bank on your behalf and request details of regular payments.</li>
				<li>Checking whether the bank will notify those who make payments to you, or whether you need to. The new bank will arrange for these payments to be switched.</li>
				<li>Monitoring both accounts carefully to check for irregularities - eg payments being made twice.</li>
				<li>If possible, keeping your old account open until you're sure the new bank can deliver the required service.</li>
				<li>Checking BCOBS for information on standards that apply to banks when transferring accounts.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The new bank will notify you once they have completed their responsibilities for the transfer.</p>
			<p>If you are unhappy with the service you have received from your bank, you should first complain to them. If you remain unhappy with the service, you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Follow the steps to make a complaint direct to a company before contacting the Financial Ombudsman">Find out about complaining or resolving a dispute with your bank on the Financial Ombudsman website</a>.</p>
			<p>Note that the ombudsman is only able to assist small businesses with an annual turnover of less than &euro;2 million and fewer than ten employees.</p>
			<p>There are several ways you might benefit from switching business bank accounts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a new account could offer more attractive interest rates or lower charges</li>
				<li>a new bank might understand your requirements better than your current bank</li>
				<li>many bank accounts come with introductory offers - eg free banking for an initial period</li>
				<li>your current bank may not offer 24-hour telephone or internet banking services - making payments and transferring funds electronically may help reduce bank charges</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, switching bank accounts can also have a number of disadvantages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>if you have security or your accounts are complex, it can still take time and there's no guarantee of avoiding problems altogether</li>
				<li>using one bank for several years can demonstrate financial stability, which can be important for applying for a loan or other sources of finance</li>
				<li>you will lose the benefits of the relationship you have with your current bank</li>
				<li>you may need to assess the possible impact of switching on other arrangements you might have with the bank - eg loans or credit cards<br />
				</li>
