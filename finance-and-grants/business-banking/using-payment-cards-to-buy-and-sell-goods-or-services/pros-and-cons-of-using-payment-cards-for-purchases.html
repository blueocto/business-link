			<h1>Using payment cards to buy and sell goods or services</h1>
			<h2>Pros and cons of using payment cards for purchases</h2>
			<p>There are many benefits to using payment cards in your business - particularly when cards are issued to staff. But there are several potential drawbacks to be aware of too.</p>
			<h3>Business benefits of payment cards</h3>
			<p>Using company credit, debit, charge or pre-paid cards to make purchases offers a number of key business benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Convenience</strong> - cards are quicker and might be cheaper to use than cheques. They're useful for everyday expenses and can be used over the phone and internet.</li>
				<li><strong>Credit</strong> - credit or charge cards can offer an interest-free period of up to 56 days, dependent on which card issuer you use.</li>
				<li>Most cards are <strong>globally recognised</strong> - using cards for foreign travel purchases may give you better exchange rates. It also reduces the need to change cash before and during travelling.</li>
				<li>Ability to <strong>monitor expenditure</strong> - you can specify which employees receive cards and set different credit limits for each card.</li>
				<li>Fast access to <strong>cash</strong> - cash can be withdrawn from ATMs. However, card issuers may levy a commission and - if given on credit - interest is payable from the day the cash is withdrawn.</li>
				<li><strong>Reduction in administration</strong> - with a company credit or charge card, you pay one bill each month, no matter how many purchases you make. Itemised monthly statements can help with your accounting and administrative procedures and make it easy to distinguish business from personal expenses. Your provider may also be able to supply a report of your annual expenditure and a breakdown of the VAT charged on purchases.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some of these benefits can also be achieved by using a personal credit or debit card. However, there are a number of pitfalls that you should be aware of. See the page in this guide on the <a href="/finance-and-grants/business-banking/using-payment-cards-to-buy-and-sell-goods-or-services/risks-of-financing-a-business-with-a-personal-credit-card.php" title="Funding your business using your personal credit card exposes you to risks and can be expensive">risks of financing a business with a personal credit card</a>.</p>
			<h3>Drawbacks of payment cards</h3>
			<p>Even though you can usually set maximum spending limits on employees' cards, be aware that you're giving your employees the opportunity to spend company money unchecked. There's the risk they could buy unsuitable or unnecessary items which can't be returned.</p>
			<p>At the very least, it's a good idea to combine card use with a normal reporting system to minimise the risk of unnecessary transactions. It may also be worth choosing cards that restrict what can be bought - eg petrol cards - as your business will have to honour every payment your employees make.</p>
			<p>As with personal payment cards, you are also open to the possibility of two further major drawbacks.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Card fraud</strong> - if the card details are discovered or revealed, you may find fraudulent purchases appearing on your statement. If this is due to an employee's negligence, your business will be liable for the payments. In addition to the potential financial loss, such situations can be time-consuming to resolve. You can <a href="http://www.financialfraudaction.org.uk/default.asp?sectionid=5&amp;pageid=126&amp;title=preventing_card_fraud" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Advice for consumers, retailers and the police on preventing financial fraud">read guidance on preventing card fraud on the Financial Fraud Action UK website</a>.</li>
				<li><strong>Debt</strong> - with the convenience of a plastic card and the time lapse between purchase and payment, it can be tempting to overextend yourself and build up debts for the business. Remember, if you make purchases with a credit card and don't pay off the bill in full, you'll incur interest charges - which can easily mount up.<br />
