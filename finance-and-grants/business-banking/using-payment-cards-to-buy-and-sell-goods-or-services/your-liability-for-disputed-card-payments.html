			<h1>Using payment cards to buy and sell goods or services</h1>
			<h2>Your liability for disputed card payments</h2>
			<p>Chargebacks can occur when a customer disputes a card transaction. Your bank can transfer liability to you and reclaim the value of the transaction from your account.</p>
			<p>Chargebacks can be made where there has been:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>fraud - for instance, where a transaction has been made with a stolen card or account number</li>
				<li>inadequate customer service - for instance, if a customer did not receive their order or the goods were defective</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Even if a transaction has been authorised and has been authenticated with a PIN it does not prevent all types of chargeback. A chargeback can be made up to 120 days after the transaction has been debited or from when the goods or services were due to be received.</p>
			<p>Of course, your customers' key statutory rights in relation to the goods and services you provide remain the same whichever payment method is used.</p>
			<p>To <strong>minimise chargebacks</strong> you must verify the identity of people making card payments. In face-to-face transactions the customer's PIN or, where a PIN cannot be used, signature is the most important security measure. If a PIN verified transaction is authorised through your terminal, you won't be liable for a chargeback unless the goods or service are not as described or are faulty. Where you cannot accept a PIN, a clear signature will help but is no guarantee against a chargeback - as this can be forged.</p>
			<p>Customer-/card-not-present transactions - such as internet, mail order or phone transactions - present a greater risk because it is more difficult to verify the customer's identity. You therefore face a greater risk of fraud and the resulting chargebacks. <a href="http://www.barclaycardbusiness.co.uk/information_zone/chargebacks/index.html" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Information explaining what chargebacks are and how to prevent losses as a result of chargebacks">Read about chargebacks on the Barclaycard Business website</a>.</p>
