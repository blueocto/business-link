			<h1>Using payment cards to buy and sell goods or services</h1>
			<h2>Types of payment cards available </h2>
			<p>If you are looking to buy or sell goods or services using payment cards, there are six main card types to be aware of. These are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>credit cards</li>
				<li>debit cards</li>
				<li>charge cards</li>
				<li>pre-paid cards</li>
				<li>business travel cards</li>
				<li>purchasing cards</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Making or receiving payment with each type of card is a similar process. What differs between each card type is their terms and conditions, and how they are funded.</p>
			<p><strong>Credit cards:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>allow the cardholder to spend up to a specified credit limit</li>
				<li>offer the account holder an interest-free period</li>
				<li>require the account holder to repay at least the minimum amount each month, but charge interest on the unpaid balance</li>
				<li>incur no interest if the bill is paid in full by the specified date</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Debit cards:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>are issued in conjunction with a bank or building society current account</li>
				<li>limit the cardholder to the funds available in that account plus any overdraft, if available</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Charge cards:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>may require the account holder to pay an annual fee</li>
				<li>allow the cardholder a period of credit, but - to avoid additional fees - this must be paid off in full each month</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Pre-paid cards</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>can be provided pre-loaded - eg for staff to pay expenses</li>
				<li>enable businesses to manage and monitor spending</li>
				<li>are available in different currencies, so can be used as an alternative to business travel cards</li>
				<li>usually incur various fees and charges - eg issuing costs, management fees, and transaction or ATM withdrawal fees</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Business travel cards:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>operate in the same way as other business credit or charge cards</li>
				<li>can offer a convenient way for staff to pay for business travelling expenses</li>
				<li>often offer additional benefits, such as travel insurance or currency facilities</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Purchasing cards:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>are generally restricted to buyers for large businesses or public sector bodies</li>
				<li>are designed to cut down on paperwork and the need for purchase orders</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Issuing payment cards to staff</h3>
			<p>With the exception of debit cards - which must be used by the signatory - all the other types of payment cards outlined above can be issued to staff for them to make business-related purchases. This can have a number of advantages, but there are also some potential pitfalls. See the page in this guide on the <a href="/finance-and-grants/business-banking/using-payment-cards-to-buy-and-sell-goods-or-services/pros-and-cons-of-using-payment-cards-for-purchases.php" title="How using credit, debit, charge and pre-paid cards can benefit your business and potential pitfalls to be aware of">pros and cons of using payment cards for purchases</a>.</p>
			<h3>Contactless payment technology</h3>
			<p>Contactless payment technology is being added to UK payment cards. Contactless cards utilise the security built into chip and PIN cards, and can be used for low value transactions of &pound;15 or less.</p>
			<p>The aim of contactless payments is to speed up transactions. Customers make their payment by holding a contactless-enabled card up to a secure reader - without needing to enter a PIN. However, after a certain number of contactless payments or for contactless payments for certain amounts of money the PIN entry device will ask the user to enter their PIN to verify that they are the cardholder using the card.</p>
