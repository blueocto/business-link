			<h1>Using payment cards to buy and sell goods or services</h1>
			<h2>Pros and cons of accepting payment cards for sales</h2>
			<p>Many businesses accept payment by card for their goods and services, which undoubtedly offer some distinct advantages. However, there are potential drawbacks that should be considered.</p>
			<h3>Advantages</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Responding to <strong>customer preferences</strong> - people expect to be able to pay by card.</li>
				<li>Encouraging <strong>impulse purchases</strong> - the customer doesn't need to have cash with them.</li>
				<li><strong>Avoiding lost sales opportunities</strong> - if a customer leaves to get cash they may not return.</li>
				<li>Reaching a <strong>wider customer base</strong> - you can accept payment by phone, mail and online from customers who can't reach your premises.</li>
				<li><strong>Cashflow improvements</strong> - card payments usually clear more quickly than cheques, although this depends on your merchant agreement. Funds can take up to four working days to reach a business' bank account for face-to-face sales - this may be different for online sales.</li>
				<li><strong>Improved security</strong> - you hold less cash on your premises.</li>
				<li><strong>Easing your admin</strong> - a regular statement of card transactions is easier to reconcile than numerous cash transactions.</li>
				<li>Cards can be <strong>used internationally</strong> and currency conversions are handled automatically - offering an important payment method for tourist-sector businesses or those selling to consumers overseas.</li>
				<li>With card payments, the customer's card is checked to see if it is valid and that it hasn't been reported lost or stolen. In addition, in a majority of cases, the customer's account is checked to ensure the funds are available. In most cases, an authorisation for the payment is given. However, a card authorisation does not guarantee that the payment will not be charged back in the future.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					There are <strong>costs</strong> involved - though these aren't usually prohibitive. See the page in this guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/business-banking/using-payment-cards-to-buy-and-sell-goods-or-services/the-costs-of-accepting-card-payments.php" title="Advice on the fees you will pay for every credit, debit or charge card transaction, and other costs to consider ">the costs of accepting card payments</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Accepting cards can increase your exposure to <strong>fraud</strong>. See the page in this guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/business-banking/using-payment-cards-to-buy-and-sell-goods-or-services/your-liability-for-disputed-card-payments.php" title="Customer refunds for fraudulent transactions and for undelivered or defective goods">your liability for disputed card payments</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					To accept and process certain major charge cards - including American Express and Diners Club - you must reach a separate agreement with the charge card company.
				</li>
				<li>
					You will need to <strong>train staff -</strong> in the technical and administrative issues of processing a card payment, as well as in fraud prevention measures.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Take into account the <strong>expectations of your business sector</strong>. If you run a service-sector business or shop selling higher-price goods, life will be difficult if you don't accept cards.</p>
