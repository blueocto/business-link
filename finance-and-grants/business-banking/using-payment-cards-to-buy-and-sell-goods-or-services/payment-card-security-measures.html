			<h1>Using payment cards to buy and sell goods or services</h1>
			<h2>Payment card security measures </h2>
			<p>There are a number of steps you can take to reduce the risk of fraudulent card payments. Training is crucial - you should draw up a clear list of security measures and make sure your employees are fully aware of them.</p>
			<p>Talk to the bank providing you with your merchant account. Ask them what security measures they recommend.</p>
			<p>When the <strong>cardholder is present</strong> you should:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>check the card hasn't been reported lost or stolen - your terminal will check this when it seeks authorisation</li>
				<li>make sure that the PIN entered verifies the transaction, or where the card is not chip &amp; PIN-enabled that the signature matches the one on the back of the card </li>
				<li>check the card is in the right format and hasn't been tampered with - ask your bank for a card-recognition guide</li>
				<li>check with your bank's authorisation phone line if the card won't swipe - this can happen for innocent reasons but it may indicate a fake card</li>
				<li>beware of people who seem nervous or who try to distract you as you're processing their purchase</li>
				<li>look out for people making hurried and seemingly random purchases, eg several pairs of designer sunglasses or high-priced electronics</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For <strong>cardholder-not-present</strong> transactions, you can:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ask for the card security code if you have the facility - usually the last three digits on the signature strip or, in the case of an American Express card, four numbers on the front of the card</li>
				<li>ask customers to bring their card when collecting goods</li>
				<li>ask for faxed confirmation of the order with a signature and proof of address</li>
				<li>check the name and address details you have been given with those held by the company which issued the card</li>
				<li>use the Address Verification Service offered by your bank, which checks the numerical details of the cardholder's address with the card issuer</li>
				<li>take advantage of specific programmes aimed at preventing fraudulent transactions - like Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode</li>

			<h3>Data protection and security standards</h3>
			<p>As with any business that stores or processes customers' personal information, you will need to ensure that your business complies with the <strong>Data Protection Act</strong>. Businesses that don't properly protect their customers' personal information can be fined up to &pound;500,000. For more information, see our guide on how to <a href="layerea71.html?topicId=1074412952" title="The correct use of personal information under the Data Protection Act 1998">comply with data protection legislation</a>.</p>
			<p>In addition to this, you will also need to ensure your operations meet the <strong>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</strong>. This is a worldwide standard developed to protect sensitive cardholder information. For more information, see the page about <a href="detailf2d4.html?itemId=1084759930&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="PCI DSS compliance, the six principles and 12 requirements that you must follow">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard compliance</a> in our guide on <a href="layer66a6.html?topicId=1073920405" title="How online payments work and how to set up a payment facility">accepting online payments</a>.</p>
