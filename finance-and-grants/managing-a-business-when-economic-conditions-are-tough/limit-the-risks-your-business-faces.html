			<h1>Managing a business when economic conditions are tough</h1>
			<h2>Limit the risks your business faces</h2>
			<p>Risks are factors that could seriously <strong>impact</strong> your business. Risks can be large or small and can be the result of external or internal factors. They can be sector-specific and/or linked to wider economic considerations.</p>
			<p>It pays to consider what you would do should certain worst-case scenarios arise, such as losing a major customer. Effective risk-management is the most efficient way to deal with such issues swiftly and decisively. Ask yourself some key 'what if?' questions.</p>
			<p>You also need to consider potential opportunities that could arise. For example, if one of your competitors goes out of business, can you provide your goods or services to their customers?</p>
			<p>Risks increase in times of economic upheaval. <strong>Inflation</strong> burdens businesses with additional costs and poor <strong>cashflow</strong> and lack of access to <strong>credit</strong> can also prove fatal. Increased <strong>competition</strong> and the risk of <strong>losing customers</strong> and/or failing to attract new ones are also risks most businesses face and which can be exacerbated by economic instability. It is also important that businesses are aware of other potential risks and problems and are able and willing to adapt to changing economic conditions.</p>
			<p><strong>Risk management</strong> means identifying potential threats and putting in place strategies to eliminate or reduce them.</p>

			<p>A <strong>SWOT analysis</strong> - considering the business' strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats - is an effective way to assess risk. While identifying your strengths enables you to recognise opportunities open to your business, potential threats can be uncovered by assessing your weaknesses.</p>
