			<h1>Managing a business when economic conditions are tough</h1>
			<h2>Analyse the health of your business</h2>
			<p>Regularly assessing your business by looking at key performance indicators enables you to identify areas you need to improve. Addressing issues early on could prevent more severe consequences later.</p>
			<p>How you organise and run your business affects your ability to manage the risks you face. For example, relying too heavily on too few customers can lead to cashflow problems for your business should one or more cease buying from you due to adverse financial conditions. See our page on <a href="detail5542.html?itemId=1073791114&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="The importance of staying aware of your customers' financial situation">how to know when your customers are in trouble</a> in our guide on how to <a href="layerb116.html?topicId=1073924632" title="How to use cashflow forecasts and business plans to avoid financial problems">identify potential cashflow problems</a>.</p>
			<p>Think about ways of developing your existing market and customers - see the page in this guide on how to <a href="/finance-and-grants/managing-a-business-when-economic-conditions-are-tough/develop-an-effective-survival-strategy.php" title="Look after key customers and plan for the survival and future success of your business">develop an effective survival strategy</a> and our guides:</p>

			</ul>
			<p>Or, you may find that the markets you serve have been severely affected by the economic conditions. In which case you may need to consider whether you can sell outside your existing market. See our guides on <a href="layerad08.html?topicId=1081822412" title="How businesses can compete and carve out a share of a marketplace dominated by bigger names">spotting market opportunities</a> and <a href="/international-trade/importing-and-exporting-basics/overseas-supplier-relationships/entering-overseas-markets.php" title="Deciding between selling directly and using an intermediary is a key choice when entering an overseas market">entering overseas markets</a>.</p>
			<p>To assess how your business is performing, you need to look at the key areas of your business and finances. This will help you to identify risks, how to manage them and any other issues that may need addressing. If in doubt, you should discuss your approach with a professional business adviser. <a href="layer7aaa.html?topicId=1077717513" title="Use our interactive tool to assess how well your business is currently performing">Use our interactive tool to assess how well your business is performing</a>.</p>
