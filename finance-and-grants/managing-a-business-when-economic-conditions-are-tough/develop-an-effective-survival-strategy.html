			<h1>Managing a business when economic conditions are tough</h1>
			<h2>Develop an effective survival strategy</h2>
			<p>When market conditions become tough or unpredictable, revisit your business plan, as previous targets might not be achievable.</p>
			<p>Before setting new targets, consider factors such as recent trading results and current market research/knowledge.</p>
			<p>Your business development strategies will also have to change. If your plans are to succeed, your goals must be realistic.</p>
			<p>It pays to consider what you would do should certain worst-case scenarios arise, such as losing a major customer. Effective planning is the most efficient way to deal with such contingencies swiftly and decisively should they occur. Ask yourself some key 'what if?' questions. You also need to consider potential opportunities that could be presented, for example, if one of your competitors goes out of business.</p>
			<p>You must have a clear strategy for looking after key customers and growing relationships with them, if you are to retain them. Keeping hold of existing customers is much cheaper than attracting new ones.</p>
			<p>
				<p>If your business experiences serious cashflow or funding problems, seek advice from your accountant or a professional adviser such as Business Link. Also seek guidance from your bank, which might be able to provide you with a short-term financial solution.</p>

			<h3>Motivating employees</h3>
			<p>You also need to think about the effect tough or uncertain market conditions can have on your employees. Morale can sink quickly and feelings of anxiety can spread when people elsewhere are losing their jobs. As well as rewarding and recognising their achievements, you need to set targets and monitor their performance.</p>
			<p>Read our guide on <a href="layer0646.html?topicId=1073965296" title="Establishing clearly defined objectives and appraisal systems can help employees and improve business performance">managing the performance of your staff</a>.</p>
			<p>Employers need to inspire confidence in their business and encourage a teamwork ethos. It is also important that you, the owner-manager, show strong, effective leadership and that you are successful in motivating those around you.</p>
			<p>In addition, in a challenging economic climate, investing in skills and training is critical to increasing the competitiveness of your business.</p>
