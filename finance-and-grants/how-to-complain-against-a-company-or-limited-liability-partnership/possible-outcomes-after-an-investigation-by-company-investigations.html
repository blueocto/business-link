			<h1>How to complain against a company or limited liability partnership</h1>
			<h2>Possible outcomes after an investigation by Company Investigations</h2>
			<p>When all the required information has been obtained by the investigators, they will consider whether or not further action is necessary.</p>
			<h3>Preventing a company from further trading</h3>
			<p>A common follow-up action is to petition the court to prevent a company from trading by winding up its affairs in the public interest. This involves a court order, which puts the company into compulsory liquidation. However, individuals involved with a company can continue to trade through another company (unless disqualified from doing so), or on their own.</p>
			<p>When the directors of a company behave unsuitably, Company Investigations can apply to the court to disqualify them from acting as company directors. Where there is evidence of unfit conduct - eg not keeping proper accounting records, trading while insolvent etc - Company Investigations can investigate the conduct of directors with a view to disqualification. Directors can be disqualified for a period of up to 15 years.</p>
			<p>If an investigation reveals that criminal offences may have taken place, or Company Investigations considers that another regulator is better placed to deal with the misconduct, information will be passed on to bodies such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills, whose prosecutions lawyers may take action</li>
				<li>the Office of Fair Trading</li>
				<li>the police</li>
				<li>the Serious Fraud Office</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Other outcomes</h3>
			<p>A warning letter can be sent by Company Investigations where the situation does not merit full follow-up action and the company has taken or is taking steps to rectify any irregularities discovered by the investigation. If the company undertakes any other unscrupulous conduct, the decision not to take further action will be reconsidered.</p>
			<p>Company Investigations does not monitor the affairs of any company and does not provide feedback to a company following an enquiry.</p>
