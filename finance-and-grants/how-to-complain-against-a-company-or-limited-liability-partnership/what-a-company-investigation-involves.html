	<h1>How to complain against a company or limited liability partnership</h1>
	<h2>What a company investigation involves</h2>
	<p>The Insolvency Service, through its Investigation and Enforcement Services (IES), deals with misconduct or unscrupulous practices by companies and limited liability partnerships (LLPs).</p>
	<p>Corporate Complaints teams consider complaints against companies or LLPs and decide which are suitable for investigation by the Company Investigations teams.</p>
	<p>Company Investigations teams can investigate companies that are still trading and can ask the court to close them down where there is sufficient evidence to do so.</p>
	<p>Company Investigations teams carry out confidential fact-finding investigations initiated by a complaint about the way a company is operating. The information gathered by the investigators may later be used to launch criminal or civil proceedings. Civil actions include winding up, disqualification of a director, or referral to professional bodies to consider disciplinary proceedings.</p>
	<h3>Organisations eligible and ineligible for investigation</h3>
	<p>Corporate Complaints can consider complaints against limited companies and limited liability partnerships that are active and have a business address in England, Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland, including overseas registered companies which are operating within the UK.</p>
	<p>They cannot investigate:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>sole traders or partnerships - unless the partnership is an LLP</li>
		<li>companies with no business address in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland</li>
		<li>dissolved companies - ie ones that are no longer active</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In addition, they do not usually investigate the affairs of companies which have gone into formal insolvency, but may become involved where there are reasonable suspicions of a serious pattern of corporate abuse.</p>
	<p>To complain about a business that is not run by a company, you should contact your local Trading Standards Department or Citizens Advice Bureau. Alternatively, if you are a consumer, Consumer Direct may be able to help. <a href="http://www.consumerdirect.gov.uk/" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Consumer issues explained on the Directgov website
">Find information on consumer issues on the Consumer Direct website</a>.</p>
	<h3>Insolvent companies</h3>
	<p>Complaints about a company that has already entered formal insolvency proceedings, eg administration, administrative receivership, and voluntary liquidation, may be considered by Corporate Complaints. However, the concerns should first be raised with the insolvency practitioner involved who may be best placed to deal with the issue.</p>
	<p>An organisation that appears to be trading while insolvent is not usually considered suitable for investigation unless there are wider concerns about its trading practices.</p>
	<p>Complaints against companies in compulsory liquidation - where a winding up order has been made by the court - will not be considered. This is because the Official Receiver - an officer of the court and a civil servant from The Insolvency Service who carries out court orders - has a duty to investigate such companies and report any matters of concern to the Secretary of State.</p>
	<h3>The types of conduct Company Investigations can investigate</h3>
	<p>There must be reasonable grounds to suspect fraud, serious misconduct, material wrong-doing or significant irregularity in a company's affairs for Company Investigations teams to investigate.</p>
	<p>They will not usually intervene where:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>an investigation, including a criminal one, is already under way - this is because there is no additional benefit for another investigation in respect of the same issues and any second investigation could hamper the existing investigation</li>
		<li>the only, or main, issue is one of non-payment of a debt - Company Investigations has no power to act as a debt collector or recovery agent</li>
		<li>the only, or main, issue is the resolution of a commercial dispute - unless a pattern of misconduct, perhaps involving a succession of companies - is apparent</li>
		<li>the only or main, issue is one of the supply of defective or incomplete goods or services. Company Investigations has no power to require a company complained of to supply, restore, renew, or repair any item, or provide any after-sales service</li>
		<li>the issue is internal to the company, its management or shareholders who are in dispute and there is no wider public interest in investigating</li>
		<li>the complaint is better dealt with by another public body, eg the Financial Services Authority in respect of a company which trades as a provider of financial services or Trading Standards Offices in relation to the non or defective supply of goods or services, or other product liability issues</li>
