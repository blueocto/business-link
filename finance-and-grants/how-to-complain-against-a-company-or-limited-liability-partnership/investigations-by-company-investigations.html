			<h1>How to complain against a company or limited liability partnership</h1>
			<h2>Investigations by Company Investigations</h2>
			<p>Company Investigations do not have to restrict their enquiries to the particular concerns raised by the original complaint. For more information, see the page in this guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/how-to-complain-against-a-company-or-limited-liability-partnership/possible-outcomes-after-an-investigation-by-company-investigations.php" title="The actions that can be taken after an investigation has been completed">possible outcomes after an investigation by Company Investigations</a>.</p>
			<h3>How an investigation is carried out</h3>
			<p>Initially, a decision will be taken by the Corporate Complaints Team as to whether there are sufficient grounds to investigate the company being complained about. For more information, see the page in this guide on <a href="detaileb5f.html?itemId=1084616701&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="How Corporate Complaints and Company Investigations work and the types of company which can, or cannot, be investigated">what a company investigation involves</a>. Through a process of gathering and assessing information, known as vetting, officials determine if the activities of a company pose a threat to the public in general. Only then will they proceed with an investigation and appoint investigators. This appointment is made by the Secretary of State under delegated authority to a departmental official.</p>
			<p>Normally, Company Investigations' own staff undertake these investigations, but sometimes other external, suitably qualified professionals are appointed to investigate under the supervision of Company Investigations staff.</p>
			<p>When an investigation takes place, the investigators will:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>visit the company without warning</li>
				<li>speak to the company's officers and ask questions</li>
				<li>examine relevant paper and electronic documents and take copies</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When required, investigators will produce copies of their authorities and identity cards. They can also, by law, ask wide-ranging questions and demand detailed information from:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>company directors</li>
				<li>company employees - past and present</li>
				<li>third parties in possession of relevant documents and information</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The length of the investigation depends on various factors such as the complexity of the issues and the amount of co-operation received. Company Investigations aims to complete 90 per cent of investigations within six months, though many are completed in less time.</p>
			<h3>Investigations and the law</h3>
			<p>Most investigations are carried out under section 447 of the Companies Act 2006 which gives the power to require documents and information as detailed above.</p>
			<p>Investigators also have the power to enter and remain on premises considered to be used in the company's business. If this power is exercised, an investigator must explain the rights and obligations of those served.</p>
			<p>If the management of a company under investigation refuse to co-operate, or there is the possibility of documents being destroyed, Company Investigations can request a search warrant from a magistrate. Investigators and police constables can then search premises to seize documents.</p>
			<p>A lack of co-operation can be treated as a contempt of court punishable by a fine or imprisonment. This will be taken into account when Company Investigations consider what action to take against a company and its officers.</p>
