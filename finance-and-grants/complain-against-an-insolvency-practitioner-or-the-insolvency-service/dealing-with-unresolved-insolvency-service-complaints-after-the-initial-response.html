			<h2>Dealing with unresolved Insolvency Service complaints after the initial response</h2>
			<p>If you have informed The Insolvency Service that you are dissatisfied with its service and with the initial response to your complaint, you should write to the relevant director or section head.</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<h3>What if my complaint has still not been resolved?</h3>
