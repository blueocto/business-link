			<h1>Complain against an insolvency practitioner or The Insolvency Service</h1>
			<h2>Complaints against The Insolvency Service</h2>
			<p>You should inform The Insolvency Service if you are dissatisfied with the service you receive from them. They will then try to resolve your complaint and ensure it does not recur.</p>
			<h3>Steps in resolving your complaint</h3>
			<p>You may be able to resolve a complaint by taking it up immediately with the individual you have been dealing with, or with their immediate manager.</p>
			<p>
				<p>If you cannot resolve the problem there and then, you can write to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the official receiver in whose office the staff member is based</li>
					<li>the Redundancy Payments Office manager if the staff member is based there</li>
					<li>the Company Investigations supervisor if the staff member is based there</li>
					<li>in the case of the Corporate Business Services sections, the relevant section head</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You can register a complaint online. <a href="detaila238.html?itemId=1084662785&amp;type=PIP" title="Make a complaint against The Insolvency Service or an insolvency practitioner">Make a complaint to The Insolvency Service</a>.</p>
				<p>You can also register a complaint by phone, although you may have to set out the details of your complaint in writing.</p>
				<p>You can get contact details for the relevant section by calling the Insolvency Service Enquiry Line on Tel 0845 602 9848. Alternatively, you can email them at <a href="mailto:insolvency.enquiryline@insolvency.gsi.gov.uk">insolvency.enquiryline@insolvency.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>
				<h3>Information to provide with your complaint</h3>
				<p>Your complaint should include the following information when submitted:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Your name and address.</li>
					<li>The name of the bankrupt or insolvent company, including the court reference if known. If your complaint is not about an insolvency case, you should give details of what has led to the complaint.</li>
					<li>Copies of any correspondence or documents about your complaint.</li>
					<li>The name of the person you first wrote or spoke to and when you spoke to them. This will help The Insolvency Service find the relevant information.</li>
					<li>Details about what has gone wrong or has not been handled properly.</li>
					<li>How you would like The Insolvency Service to resolve your complaint.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>What will happen next?</h3>
				<p>The Insolvency Service will try to give a written reply to your complaint within ten working days of receipt. If this is not possible, they will send you a written acknowledgment within five working days, explaining why and telling you when you can expect a full reply.</p>
				<p>The Insolvency Service recognises that each complaint is different and must be dealt with in a way appropriate to the circumstances. They aim to reply to 90 per cent of all complaints within the above time and the remaining 10 per cent within 20 working days.</p>
