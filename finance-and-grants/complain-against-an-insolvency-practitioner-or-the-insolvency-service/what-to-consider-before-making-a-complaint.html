			<h1>Complain against an insolvency practitioner or The Insolvency Service</h1>
			<h2>What to consider before making a complaint</h2>
			<p>As a creditor or a debtor, if you are unhappy about the conduct of an insolvency practitioner (IP), you may first be able to resolve your complaint by taking it up with the IP concerned.</p>
			<p>If you cannot resolve your complaint directly with the IP and you consider that they are acting 'unprofessionally, improperly or unethically', you can make a complaint to the appropriate authorising body. For a full list and contact details of these bodies see the page in this guide: <a href="/finance-and-grants/complain-against-an-insolvency-practitioner-or-the-insolvency-service/directory-of-authorised-professional-bodies.php" title="Contact details of authorised professional bodies, and information on what they are responsible for">directory of authorised professional bodies</a>.</p>
			<p>An IP should give details of their authorising body on request. Alternatively, you can find this information:
				<ul>
					<li>on The Insolvency Service's searchable database of IPs - you can <a href="detail170c.html?itemId=1084612572&amp;type=PIP" title="Find contact details of insolvency practitioners in your area">find an IP with The Insolvency Service</a></li>
					<li>by calling the Insolvency Service Enquiry Line on Tel 0845 602 9848</li>
					<li>by emailing The Insolvency Service at <a href="mailto:insolvency.enquiryline@insolvency.gsi.gov.uk">insolvency.enquiryline@insolvency.gsi.gov.uk</a></li>
					<li>by writing to the Insolvency Practitioner Policy Section (IPPS)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>You can write to the IPPS at:</p>
			<p>Insolvency Practitioner Policy Section<br />
				The Insolvency Service<br />
				Zone B<br />
				Third Floor<br />
				21 Bloomsbury Street<br />
				London<br />
				WC1B 3QW</p>
			<p>If you are not sure who is acting as the IP for a particular case, you will need to supply the full name of the insolvency case when making your enquiry.</p>
			<h3>Limit of authorising bodies' powers</h3>
			<p>The Secretary of State or the authorising body cannot intervene directly in individual insolvencies, nor can they give directions in relation to the conduct of individual cases, or reverse or modify the decision of an IP.</p>
			<p>Insolvency deals with a number of competing interests, most notably between the insolvent party and their creditors. Ultimately, commercial and other disputes may only be resolved by the courts. The authorising body's disciplinary procedures should not be regarded as an alternative to the powers available to individuals under the Insolvency Act 1986.</p>
			<h3>Complaints against case administrators or case managers</h3>
			<p>The IP is the person who is responsible for the insolvency case and the staff that run it. Therefore, complaints against a case administrator or a case manager, for example, should be taken up with the relevant IP.</p>
