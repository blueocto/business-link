			<h1>How to wind up a company that owes you money</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Companies go into compulsory liquidation when they become insolvent - that is, unable to pay their debts, or with assets worth less than their debts - and no arrangement has been agreed with creditors.</p>
			<p>If an insolvent company owes you money, you can ask the court to make a compulsory winding-up order against it. Generally, this only happens after you have exhausted all other ways of recovering your money.</p>
			<p>Once the order has been made the court informs the official receiver (OR) who becomes the liquidator. The OR interviews the directors and informs the creditors of the liquidation. If the OR believes the company has enough assets for something to be paid to its creditors the OR will seek the appointment of an insolvency practitioner as liquidator - either by calling a creditors' meeting for the creditors to vote for the liquidator or by asking the Secretary of State to appoint one. If there are no assets the OR will remain liquidator.</p>
			<p>You must be owed at least &pound;750, without dispute, before you can ask for a winding-up order. Orders can be requested either by other businesses or individuals.</p>
			<p>This guide explains the circumstances under which compulsory winding-up orders can be made, and creditors can attempt to recover their money through the courts.</p>
			<p>The Insolvency Service is the government agency responsible for investigating the financial failure and misconduct of individuals and companies. The official receiver works for The Insolvency Service and finds out how and why an individual became bankrupt or a company went into compulsory liquidation.</p>
