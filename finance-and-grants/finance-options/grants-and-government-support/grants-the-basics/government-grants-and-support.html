			<h1>Grants: the basics</h1>
			<h2>Government grants and support</h2>
			<p>The government provides support to businesses both financially, in the form of grants, and through access to expert advice, information and services. See our guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/finance-options/grants-and-government-support/government-support-for-businesses.php" title="Government support available to businesses, including financial support, advice, information and skills training">government support for businesses</a>.</p>
			<p>However, getting financial support can be tough. There will be strong competition and the eligibility criteria for grants are stringent. Criteria vary but are likely to include the location, size and industry sector of the business. See the page in this guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/finance-options/grants-and-government-support/grants-the-basics/grant-eligibility.php" title="Location, industry sector, personal circumstances and purpose of grant can determine your eligibility ">grant eligibility</a>.</p>
			<p>Government grants are almost always awarded for a specific purpose or project and are usually for <strong>proposed projects</strong> only - not for those that have already started.</p>
			<p>There are also strict terms and conditions that apply to all grants. If these aren't followed, immediate repayment of the grant can be required. However, generally you do not have to repay grants or interest on them unless you break the conditions.</p>
			<h3>Matching grant funds</h3>
			<p>Most government grants require you to match the funds you are being awarded. In other words, the grant covers a proportion of the money needed, while you supply the rest. You must also demonstrate that your business can provide its share of the total costs.</p>
			<p>The amount of matching funds varies from grant to grant. A research grant may require a business to find 40 per cent of the total cost with 60 per cent provided by the grant. However, a grant to refurbish a factory may require a considerably higher percentage of match funding from the business.</p>
			<p>The matching funds may be found from the owners of the business, retained profits, a loan, or from a new investor.</p>
