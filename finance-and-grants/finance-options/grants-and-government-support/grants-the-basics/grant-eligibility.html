			<h1>Grants: the basics</h1>
			<h2>Grant eligibility</h2>
			<p>There are a number of factors which could affect your eligibility for a grant.</p>
			<h3>Location of your business</h3>
			<p>Each of the countries of the UK has its own range of grants available. Some areas get extra grants, for example because of social deprivation or high unemployment.</p>
			<p>Some grants are also given by local authorities to help local businesses.</p>
			<h3>Size of your business</h3>
			<p>You may only be eligible for some grants if your business is of a particular size, measured either by turnover or the number of employees.</p>
			<p>Many grants are limited to small or medium-sized enterprises - typically those with fewer than 250 employees.</p>
			<h3>Your industry sector</h3>
			<p>Funding can be limited and subject to restrictions in certain sectors defined by the European Commission. Any applications that are made for grants will be closely inspected by the Commission.</p>
			<h3>The purpose of the grant</h3>
			<p>Grants are often awarded for a specific purpose such as purchasing machinery, improving offices, increasing employment or developing export markets.</p>
			<p>Grant bodies prefer to see specific targets and results - often compatible with their own objectives.</p>
			<p>As well as making an assessment of the benefits of your project, the awarding body will expect a high level of commitment from you and your business and for the project to be commercially viable.</p>
			<p>Whether you are eligible for a grant will depend on the terms and conditions of the specific grant for which you apply.</p>
