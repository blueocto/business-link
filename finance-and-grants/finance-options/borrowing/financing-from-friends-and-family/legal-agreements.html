			<h1>Financing from friends and family</h1>
			<h2>Legal agreements</h2>
			<p>If you decide to finance your business from a friend or family member's investment, you can <strong>prevent misunderstandings</strong> by having a formal agreement in place. The agreement should be witnessed by an independent person.</p>
			<p>Key elements to include in a written agreement are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					the nature and timing of return on the investment - such as how much a loan is for and whether an investor is to receive profits or a share in the business
				</li>
				<li>a repayment schedule or timed plan of dividend payments - include dates, amounts and interest on loans if applicable</li>
				<li>respective responsibilities - for an investor this should state whether they are to have a role in the business or any liabilities</li>
				<li>how any problems will be resolved</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This will ensure both parties are clear about the terms on which the money will be transferred.</p>
			<p>You should both consider getting legal advice if the loan amounts involved are substantial for either of you. You can <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/choosingandusing/findasolicitor.law" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="An explanation of how Lawyers for your Business works and what it can do to help">find a solicitor online on the Law Society website</a>.</p>
			<p>For loans, you can reduce the cost of legal advice by preparing a <strong>draft agreement</strong> to discuss with your legal adviser. Some websites will prepare a draft <strong>promissory note</strong> - a legal document that is less formal than a full loan agreement, but which still sets out all the relevant details clearly. For example, you can <a href="http://www.lawdepot.co.uk/contracts/promnote/?loc=GB" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk">draft a sample promissory note on the LawDepot website</a>.</p>
			<p>For more complex investment agreements, both parties should decide the role and responsibilities of the investor and what their rewards - such as shares or dividends - will be prior to asking a professional to draft a full agreement.
