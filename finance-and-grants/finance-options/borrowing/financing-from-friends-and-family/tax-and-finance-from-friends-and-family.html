			<h1>Financing from friends and family</h1>
			<h2>Tax and finance from friends and family</h2>
			<p>Some loans are <strong>interest-bearing</strong> while some are <strong>interest-free</strong>.</p>
			<p>Interest-bearing loans - even those with low rates - have <strong>tax implications</strong> for you and the lender:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you may deduct loan interest on business loans from your taxable profit</li>
				<li>the lender must declare interest received as taxable income</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, if the loan is interest-free, there are no tax implications for either borrower or lender.</p>
			<p>It is good practice to set out the loan's interest and repayment terms in a <strong>written agreement</strong> - see the page in this guide on <a href="detail8eb5.html?itemId=1073789666&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="Why you should treat finance from friends and family as a formal arrangement">setting up a loan or investment with friends or family</a>. Both sides should keep <strong>records</strong> of all repayments.</p>
			<p>If you have sold shares in your business to a friend or a family member and you make dividend payments to them, keep full records. You may not deduct such payments from your business' taxable profits, but the recipient must declare them as taxable income in the year they receive the money. See our guide to <a href="layer2157.html?topicId=1074429027" title="The advantages of selling shares in your company and the entitlements of an individual who buys shares">shares and shareholders</a>.</p>
