			<h1>Financing from friends and family</h1>
			<h2>Benefits and pitfalls of friends and family finance</h2>
			<p>There are clear benefits to approaching family or friends, rather than conventional sources of funding, for a loan or investment. Generally, they will be flexible. On a practical level, they may offer loans without security or accept less security than banks. They may also lend funds interest-free or at a low rate.</p>
			<p>Friends and family may agree to a longer repayment period or lower return on their investment than formal lenders. They may also seek a lower rate of initial return than commercial backers.</p>
			<p>On a personal level, they already know your character and circumstances and so are less likely to need a detailed business plan.</p>
			<p>However, transactions of this nature can be complex. Any misunderstandings about the arrangement can damage relationships. There is a risk your investors may offer more than they can afford to lose, or that they will demand their money back when it suits them but not your business. They may also want to get more involved in the business, which may not be appropriate.</p>
			<p>It's a good idea to approach friends and family in the same way you would a formal lender:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Be crystal clear about your own <strong>expectations</strong> - specify how long you need the money for.</li>
				<li>Detail the repayment level you can afford.</li>
				<li>Spell out how many shares or what profit the investor will receive - and when any returns will be paid.</li>
				<li>Clarify whether an investor will have any financial liabilities for your business activity.</li>
				<li>Draw up a <strong>formal written agreement.</strong> See the page in this guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/finance-options/borrowing/financing-from-friends-and-family/setting-up-a-loan-or-investment-with-friends-or-family.php" title="Why you should treat finance from friends and family as a formal arrangement">setting up a loan or investment with friends or family</a>.</li>
				<li>Think twice about approaching a friend or family member if other sources of finance have turned you down. Analyse the reasons for this and review your business proposition. Remember that if your business fails, lenders and investors may lose their money.</li>
				<li>Pass on the reasons that others gave for turning you down.</li>
