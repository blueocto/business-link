			<h1>Bank finance</h1>
			<h2>Types of bank finance for businesses</h2>
			<p>There are several types of bank finance available to your business, with different packages available to suit your needs as your business requirements change. The type of finance that would best suit your business may be based on the purpose of the finance, how quickly you need finance, and how quickly you could repay it.</p>
			<h3>Short-term finance</h3>
			<p><strong>Overdrafts</strong> are used in conjunction with business bank accounts and are a flexible source of working capital for short-term needs. For more information, see the page in this guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/finance-options/borrowing/bank-finance/overdrafts.php" title="The flexibility, advantages, drawbacks and costs of using an overdraft facility">overdrafts</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Bridging finance</strong> is provided by the bank to businesses to maintain cashflow while awaiting funds from grant cheques, drawdown of commercial mortgages or loan agreements, or other confirmed sources of future income.</p>
			<h3>Working capital funding</h3>
			<p><strong>Invoice finance</strong> offers ways to access working capital by unlocking the value of invoices, although interest rates and charges apply on the cash advanced. <strong>Invoice discounting</strong> allows you to draw on funding secured against approved invoices, while in <strong>factoring</strong> you can sell invoices to your financier. If your buyer introduces a <strong>supplier finance</strong> scheme (also known as supply chain finance or reverse factoring), this will provide the same benefits at a potentially much lower cost.</p>
			<p>See our guide on <a href="layerc47e.html?topicId=1073924180" title="How to improve cashflow by selling your invoices to a third party before the invoices are paid by your customers">factoring and invoice discounting: the basics</a>.</p>
			<h3>Medium-term finance</h3>
			<p><strong>Term loans</strong> have a fixed or variable interest rate and mature over a one- to seven-year period. They are typically used to buy fixed assets such as property or machinery or other purchases of a capital nature. For more information, see the page in this guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/finance-options/borrowing/bank-finance/loans.php" title="What loans are, their advantages and disadvantages, and how to know when they are suitable for your business' needs">loans</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Asset finance and leasing</strong> options allow businesses to spread the ownership associated with buying assets. When you buy assets through leasing finance, the leasing bank buys the equipment for you to use, in exchange for regular payments. Leasing or hire purchase can help you maintain cashflow and allow greater flexibility in upgrading equipment.</p>
			<p>For more information, see our guide on how to <a href="layer5ec4.html?topicId=1073959001" title="The pros and cons of leasing and buying outright">decide whether to lease or buy assets</a>.</p>
			<h3>Long-term finance</h3>
			<p><strong>Commercial mortgages</strong> are provided by banks to finance the purchase of business premises. Types of mortgage available include repayment, commercial endowment or pension. The mortgage will usually be repayable over a 15-year period.</p>
			<p>You can get advice on the best providers of commercial mortgages from your bank's business adviser or a commercial mortgage broker. For more information, see our guide on <a href="layer1bb9.html?topicId=1074034001" title="How to find a mortgage or broker to suit your business situation">commercial mortgages and lenders</a>.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.nacfb.org/find_a_broker.html" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Find a specialist finance broker">Search for specialist commercial finance brokers on the National Association of Commercial Finance Brokers website</a> or call the NACFB Enquiry on Tel 01392 440 040.</p>
			<p><strong>Fixed asset loans</strong> are loans for assets that cannot easily be turned into cash - eg property, plant or machinery. The loans can be fixed for up to ten years. With this type of loan, the asset itself is the collateral and can be repossessed if you do not maintain repayments. For more information, see our guide on how to <a href="layer5ec4.html?topicId=1073959001" title="The pros and cons of leasing and buying outright">decide whether to lease or buy assets</a>.</p>
			<p>Banks may also provide a range of specialist services to fund expansions, mergers or acquisitions. For more information, see our guide on how to <a href="layer57af.html?topicId=1087238865" title="Long-term funding options available for larger businesses by issuing and selling bonds through debt capital markets">raise long-term funding through debt capital markets</a>.</p>
			<p>However, there may be situations when you are unable to obtain finance from a bank. If this is the case, there are other finance options available to you - see our guide on <a href="layer7178.html?topicId=1087182552" title="Non-bank finance options for businesses and how to choose between them">non-bank finance</a>.</p>
