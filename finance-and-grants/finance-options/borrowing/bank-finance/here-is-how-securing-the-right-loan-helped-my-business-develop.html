			<h1>Here's how securing the right loan helped my business develop</h1>
			<h2>Here's how securing the right loan helped my business develop</h2>
			<p>James Sirrell founded electrical contracting business Spectrum ESM in 2006. The company, based near Lutterworth, Leicestershire, used an overdraft facility and a loan to help fund its unexpectedly fast expansion.</p>
			<h3>What I did</h3>
			<br />
			<h4>Arranged an overdraft to help my cashflow</h4>
			<p>"I went from employing two people to using 12 within a few months. That saw my wage bills going from around &pound;3,000 to &pound;16,000 a month. Cashflow became a massive problem.</p>
			<p>"I have a &pound;12,000 overdraft limit now and once a month I go up to it. It costs me at the end of the month whatever the interest is, but it's not a massive amount.</p>
			<p>"We couldn't operate without it. Wage bills, the VAT return, buying new materials&hellip; it all won't wait, and 30 to 60 days is not an uncommon time for us to have to wait for payment from jobs. The funds enabled me to continue to take on customers and develop."</p>
			<h4>Kept in close contact with my bank manager</h4>
			<p>"I developed an excellent relationship with my bank and now speak to the bank manager every week to tell him what's happening.</p>
			<p>"I used to go over the overdraft limit every month as I took on big jobs and struggled to cope but things have been getting better and better. The first month I stayed within my limit the bank manager actually rang me up to congratulate me."</p>
			<h4>Use my loan as backup</h4>
			<p>"Early into my second year, a company we did a lot of work for went into insolvency. We had about &pound;23,000 tied up with it. I couldn't increase my overdraft or get a business loan as Spectrum ESM was still quite new, so I took a &pound;13,000 personal loan to keep the company going. I arranged it on the phone with a high street building society and didn't need any collateral.</p>
			<p>"In this trade if you don't have the money to buy the materials - cables, switches, sockets, trunking, lights - you can't do the job. We have subcontractors who work with us and they expect to be paid every week, too."</p>
			<h3>What I'd do differently</h3>
			<br />
			<h4>Change banks earlier</h4>
			<p>"My first months were hard work. Telling your lads you can't pay them is very difficult. I should have moved banks straight away when the first one wouldn't give me an overdraft. An overdraft for me is a business essential."</p>
			<h4>Protect against non-paying customers</h4>
			<p>"If I'd taken out insurance with my bank against customers defaulting on their payments, I would have been paid when they went insolvent. If they don't pay up you can claim it through your cover. The bank credit check your customers as part of the cover, to assess the risk - so the bank has the risk not you."</p>
			<h4>Plan to fund growth</h4>
			<p>"Grow slow, don't grow too fast as we did in our first couple of years. That's why we had a cashflow problem. Walk before you run. Get a couple of years under your belt and some money in the bank before you take on big jobs and start expanding."</p>
