			<h1>Bank finance</h1>
			<h2>Obtaining a loan and offering security</h2>
			<p>When securing a loan, there are certain requirements you may need to fulfil. Most lenders require you to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>share the financial risk by providing capital up to the same amount as you want to borrow - demonstrating your commitment and providing a contingency for repayment if things go wrong</li>
				<li>provide security for borrowing requests - eg personal or business assets, such as your home or business premises</li>
				<li>provide personal guarantees if you run a limited company, and the business cannot offer adequate security</li>
				<li>keep them informed of your progress, particularly changes or problems</li>
				<li>have a comprehensive business plan and cashflow forecast for larger borrowing requests</li>
				<li>have a good credit record - including a good payment record with other creditors</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For information on banks' credit rating and scoring, see the page on <a href="detail99dc.html?itemId=1087446085&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="Credit ratings are used by financial institutions as part of their decision-making process on finance applications">credit rating and scoring</a> in our guide on<a href="layer596f.html?topicId=1087443478" title="Making sure your business is ready to apply for funding will help if you are seeking additional finance"> obtaining bank financing</a>.</p>
			<h3>Agreeing the terms of your loan</h3>
			<p>Aside from discussing basic issues, such as the due date of the loan and the interest rate, you also need to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>establish what the lender's loan fees are</li>
				<li>agree the covenants</li>
				<li>check if you can make overpayments</li>
				<li>see if there is an early repayment charge</li>
				<li>find out if you can take 'repayment holidays'</li>
				<li>check to see that late payment charges are practicable</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is often a good idea to seek professional advice on the terms of the loan and security requirements. They can help you choose the type of loan and lender best suited for your business.</p>

			<h3>Standards of conduct for lenders</h3>
			<p>The Lending Standards Board has replaced the Banking Code Standards Board. The British Bankers' Association (BBA), Building Societies Association and UK Cards Association <strong>lending code</strong> aims to ensure that business standards are maintained when providing overdrafts, unsecured loans and credit cards to personal and small business customers. Under the code, you can access information on how credit assessment should be carried out and how to manage cases of financial difficulty.</p>
			<p>The code also makes new requirements on risk-based re-pricing, a period of grace for credit card customers in financial difficulties, and good practice for dealing with customers with a mental health condition who are in financial difficulties.</p>
			<p>The lending code is a voluntary code of practice for financial institutions to follow when dealing with personal and business customers with an annual turnover of under &pound;1 million. There are specific principles that commit banks to working in partnership with small businesses to ensure the best possible outcome for the business, its employees and community.</p>
			<p>Businesses with an annual turnover of more than &pound;1 million come under the general principles of the Financial Services Authority.</p>
