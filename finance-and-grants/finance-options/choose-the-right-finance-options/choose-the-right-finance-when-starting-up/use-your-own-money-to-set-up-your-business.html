			<h1>Choose the right finance when starting up</h1>
			<h2>Use your own money to set up your business</h2>
			<p>If you're starting a new business, it's likely that you'll have to put up at least some of the money yourself. In fact, it's usually difficult to borrow from a bank or attract other investors unless you're also investing some of your own money.</p>
			<p>The easiest and most cost-effective way to provide your own financing for a new business is to use your own savings. However, this can be risky, and you may not have enough to cover all the funding you need. You could also consider</p>
			<ul>
				<li>getting a mortgage - or a second mortgage</li>
				<li>borrowing privately - see our guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/finance-options/borrowing/financing-from-friends-and-family.php" title="Looks at the pros and cons of getting a loan from friends and family and explains your tax position on repayments">financing from friends and family</a></li>
				<li>getting an unsecured loan, or borrowing on credit cards</li>
				<li>selling possessions or assets</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You should always think carefully before borrowing any amount of money and should always aim to match the financing to your needs. For example, using credit cards for long-term expenditure can be very expensive, while some loans can be inflexible - you could end up paying interest over many years.</p>
			<p>Its also important not to over-extend yourself. If you borrow too much, you may not have enough money left over to cover your living costs while the business gets going. You should also try to leave a contingency fund, in case you need extra money to see you through a difficult period.</p>
			<p>Self-financing your business gives you far more control than other finance options. It also means that you don't need to pay back or rely on outside investors or lenders, who could decide to withdraw their support at any time.</p>
			<p>However, you must be aware of the risks of financing a new business yourself. For example if your business were to fail, you could lose your home and other personal possessions. And just knowing how much you have borrowed can put a lot of pressure on you and your family.</p>
			<p>It's always a good idea to take professional advice before making a final decision on financing.</p>
