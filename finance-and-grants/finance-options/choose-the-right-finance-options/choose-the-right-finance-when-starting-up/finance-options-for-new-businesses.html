			<h1>Choose the right finance when starting up</h1>
			<h2>Finance options for new businesses</h2>
			<p>The type of finance you choose will depend on what kind of business you are starting, how much money you need and what you will use it for. For example, you could:</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Use your own <strong>savings</strong> or personal borrowings to fund the business, particularly if you can't obtain finance or investment from external sources - see the page in this guide on how to <a href="/finance-and-grants/finance-options/choose-the-right-finance-options/choose-the-right-finance-when-starting-up/use-your-own-money-to-set-up-your-business.php" title="The advantages and disadvantages of using your own money and personal borrowing to fund a new business ">use your own money to set up your business</a>.</li>
					<li>Borrow money from<strong> family or friends</strong>. However you should carefully consider the risk that they could lose their money if your business fails - see our guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/finance-options/borrowing/financing-from-friends-and-family.php" title="Looks at the pros and cons of getting a loan from friends and family and explains your tax position on repayments">financing from friends and family</a>.</li>
					<li><strong>Borrow from a bank</strong> if you have a credible business plan and can offer some security. Many businesses use overdrafts for day-to-day borrowing and to manage cashflow, and loans for long-term funding, or to finance large purchases such as equipment. If your business is likely to have peaks and troughs in its cashflow, it's essential to be able to clearly illustrate these to your bank so you can plan an overdraft. When considering bank finance, it is generally a good idea to take professional advice from your accountant or business adviser.</li>
					<li>Aim to attract <strong>outside investors -</strong> eg by selling shares to business angels or venture capitalists. This can provide short-term finance without the need for repayment, and can also bring in expertise along with funding. However, it usually means giving up shares in your business, and investors may want some control over its management. See our guides on <a href="/finance-and-grants/finance-options/shares-and-equity-finance/shares-and-shareholders.php" title="The advantages of selling shares in your company and the entitlements of an individual who buys shares">shares and shareholders</a> and <a href="/finance-and-grants/finance-options/shares-and-equity-finance/equity-finance.php" title="What equity finance is and how to find it">equity finance</a>.</li>
					<li>Qualify for a <strong>grant</strong> or government support. These can provide very cheap financing, and often come with business advice or subsidised consultancy. However, there is usually a lot of competition for grant schemes, and you will need to meet various criteria - depending on the scheme. See our guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/finance-options/grants-and-government-support/government-support-for-businesses.php" title="Government support available to businesses, including financial support, advice, information and skills training">governemt support for businesses</a>.</li>
					<li>If you are finding it difficult to obtain bank finance, you could also consider <strong>commercial lenders</strong> - such as insurance companies and building societies. You may get a better deal - eg lower interest rates - and they are generally less restrictive - eg if you have a poor credit rating. However, commercial lenders are also subject to fewer regulations than banks and you may have to provide some security in order to obtain funding. </li>
					<li>Look for finance from other areas - eg from a community development finance institution - if your business only needs a small amount of funding, or if you are setting up in a deprived area, or in a sector not normally covered by banks or other lenders. See the page in this guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/finance-options/choose-the-right-finance-options/choose-the-right-finance-when-starting-up/other-sources-of-finance.php" title="Sourcing finance from community development finance institutions and peer group lenders ">other sources of finance</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Most businesses use a mixture of finance sources. For example, you might invest your own money to cover market research, bring in outside investors to share the risk and borrow from the bank to purchase equipment and machinery.</p>
