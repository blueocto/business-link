			<h1>Here's how I found the right sort of finance for my new business</h1>
			<h2>Here's how I found the right sort of finance for my new business</h2>
			<p>Mimimyne, a London-based online retailer of eco-friendly children's products, started trading in September 2008. The company's managing director, Tabitha Potts, wanted her business to have a high-quality website to reflect the design and workmanship of the products she planed to sell. Here Tabitha explains how she found the finance she needed to set up her business.</p>
			<h3>What I did</h3>
			<br />
			<h4>Considered all options</h4>
			<p>"I researched every option and looked into a range of different sources of finance. I've worked as a researcher, so I'm good at finding information and sifting through it quickly. I did it all on the internet.</p>
			<p>"I didn't want to approach family and friends because I was looking for about &pound;10,000, which I thought was an awful lot to ask for. I also didn't want to mix my personal and business affairs."</p>
			<h4>Searched for grants</h4>
			<p>"I used the Business and IP Centre at the British Library, which has a grant and funding database, as well as Grantnet, J4B Grants and Business Link to find grants, but I couldn't find anything suitable for me.</p>
			<p>"A couple of them offered small sums, while others were either for small charities and social enterprises, or for large companies trying to go green. But I wasn't eligible."</p>
			<h4>Pitched for loans</h4>
			<p>"I then approached banks. I only wanted to go to an ethical bank, but Triodos and the Co-operative Bank both wanted match funding, which I wasn't able to provide.</p>
			<p>"Next I went to Fair Finance, which offers community loans in my area. They were helpful but I had to offer my house as security and I didn't feel comfortable with that. I even went to an ethical business angel but I was too small to be considered.</p>
			<p>"Then I met with the East London Small Business Centre (ELSBC). I presented to about ten people, but I treated the pitch like a conversation and I knew my financial projections and the figures in my marketing plan.</p>
			<p>"I now have a &pound;10,000 loan from the ELSBC through Deutsche Bank. It has to be repaid over three years. They have been very helpful and given me a couple of months' payment holiday while I set things up."</p>
			<h3>What I'd do differently</h3>
			<br />
			<h4>I'd ask for a bigger loan</h4>
			<p>"I underestimated costs. For example, there were some things I just hadn't anticipated, such as the cost of going to trade shows where I had to pay for everything, from an awning to price tags."</p>
