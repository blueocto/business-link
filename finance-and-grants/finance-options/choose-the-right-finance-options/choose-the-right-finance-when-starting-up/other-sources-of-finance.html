			<h1>Choose the right finance when starting up</h1>
			<h2>Other sources of finance</h2>
			<p>If you are finding it difficult to obtain finance from the normal sources - eg from a bank or investor - there are more options to consider, for example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>community development finance institutions</strong> (CDFIs) - can provide finance to businesses who only need a small amount of funding and who can't obtain it from banks or other lenders</li>
				<li><strong>peer group lenders</strong> - are organisations that specialise in providing funding and business support to business owners of a particular age or background, or for businesses of a certain size or type</li>
				<li>as a new business, you may be eligible for <strong>tax breaks</strong> - eg lower tax or National Insurance contributions rates</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>CDFIs</h3>
			<p>CDFIs are sustainable, independent organisations established to develop and create wealth in disadvantaged communities or markets. They provide capital and support to individuals, micro enterprises and small businesses.</p>
			<p>A loan from a CDFI can be used to purchase equipment or property, to finance working or start-up capital or to fund marketing campaigns. Loans can be for as little as &pound;50 or up to &pound;1 million depending on the project. <a href="http://www.cdfa.org.uk/" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Search for providers of community finance loans and support">Find out about CDFIs on the Community Development Finance Association website</a>.</p>
			<h3>Peer group lenders</h3>
			<p>Some businesses find that they can access finance, support and advice from other businesses in their peer group - known as peer-group lenders. There are many organisations that have been set up to support specific groups of individuals and businesses. These include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Prowess - the UK association of businesses and individuals that specifically support women in business. <a href="http://www.prowess.org.uk/support.asp" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk">Find out about the support available to women in business on the Prowess website</a>.</li>
				<li>The Asian Business Development Network (ABDN) Ethnic Minority Enterprise Network - assists Asian and minority businesses by creating access to opportunities and sharing best practice. <a href="http://www.abdn.org.uk/" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Network dedicated to supporting ethnic minority businesses">Read about the Ethnic Minority Enterprise Network on the ABDN website</a>.</li>
				<li>The Black Business Initiative (BBI) - aims to support the black and minority business community. <a href="http://www.bbinitiative.com/" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk">Find information on the services provided by the BBI on the BBI website</a>.</li>

			<h3>Tax advantages for new businesses</h3>
			<p>As a new business, you may also be eligible for tax allowances and reliefs - see our guide on <a href="/tax-payroll-and-company-information/tax-reliefs-and-allowances/tax-advantages-for-those-starting-up-in-business.php" title="The tax allowances and reliefs available to new businesses">tax advantages for those starting up in business</a>.</p>
			<p>New businesses may also be able to benefit from the government's Regional Employer NICs holiday scheme. This may entitle you to a reduction in your NICs. For more information, see our guide on <a href="detailf3a7.html?itemId=1085763708&amp;type=ONEOFFPAGE">regional employer NICs holiday for new businesses</a>.</p>
