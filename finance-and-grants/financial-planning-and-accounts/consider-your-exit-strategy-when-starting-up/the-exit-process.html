            <h1>Consider your exit strategy when starting up</h1>
            <h2>The exit process</h2>
            <p>The process you will have to go through will depend on how you are exiting the business.</p>
            <h3>Selling the business</h3>
            <p>If you are selling the business there are several stages you will go through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    grooming your business for sale
                </li>
                <li>
                    valuing your business
                </li>
                <li>
                    identifying and marketing your business to potential buyers
                </li>
                <li>
                    negotiating with potential buyers
                </li>
                <li>
                    completing legal due diligence
                </li>
                <li>
                    finalising the sale and transferring ownership
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Prior to the sale, you should get the business into shape by reducing unnecessary overheads, debts and excess stock and getting your finances into good order. You will also require detailed financial information, including audited accounts and forecasts which you can prepare in advance. You can read specific information in our guide on <a href="/buy-or-sell-a-business/considering-selling-a-business/preparing-to-sell-your-business.php" title="Options for selling your business, making it attractive to purchasers and finding advisers">preparing to sell your business</a>.</p>
            <p>You should seek specialist advice from your accountant, solicitor or corporate finance adviser. They will help you reach a realistic valuation, and identify and market your business to potential buyers. For further information see our guide on how to <a href="/buy-or-sell-a-business/considering-selling-a-business/value-and-market-your-business.php" title="Setting a price, building a marketing proposition and identifying possible buyers for your business">value and market your business</a>.</p>
            <p>For further information on completing the sales process, see our guide on how to <a href="/buy-or-sell-a-business/selling/complete-the-sale-of-your-business.php" title="Negotiating the sale of your business, assessing offers and understanding the legal and tax implications">complete the sale of your business</a>.</p>
            <h3>Flotation</h3>
            <p>Businesses planning a flotation will go through a similar process and will require a detailed business plan, prospectus and accounts which comply with specific accounting standards. For further information on floating your company, see our guide on <a href="/buy-or-sell-a-business/floating-on-the-stock-market.php" title="The pros and cons of making a company public and how the flotation process works">floating on a stock market</a>.</p>
            <h3>Closing the business</h3>
            <p>If you are simply closing the business, the process should be much simpler. You should contact the relevant authorities to advise them you are closing down and calculate and pay off any outstanding liabilities (such as VAT) and debts. See our guide on <a href="layer619c.html?topicId=1074018703" title="Having an exit strategy may be the best way to ensure a pain-free sale or liquidation">selling or closing your business - an overview</a>.</p>
            <p>If you have employed any workers you will also need to give them the proper notice and any outstanding pay and benefits. For further information on making employees redundant, see our guides on how to <a href="layer946d.html?topicId=1074038949" title="Understand contractual and statutory notice periods, and minimum payment rights">issue the correct periods of notice</a> and on <a href="layer19db.html?topicId=1074019927" title="Legal obligations when making employees redundant">redundancy: the options</a>.</p>
