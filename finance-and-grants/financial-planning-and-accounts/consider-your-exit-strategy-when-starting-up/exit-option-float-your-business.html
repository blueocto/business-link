    <h1>Consider your exit strategy when starting up</h1>
    <h2>Exit option: float your business</h2>
    <p>Floating your business - selling shares on the stock market - can be highly rewarding financially. It lets you realise your investment in the business by making it easier to sell part of or your entire stake in the business.</p>
    <p>But any financial exit from the business is likely to be partial. Potential investors will be wary if you sell all your shares - and you may not be permitted to do so.</p>
    <p>Any float will also affect other existing shareholders or investors. The shareholders agreement may give existing shareholders pre-exemption or voting rights which may make a float more difficult or reduce the amount you can realise.</p>
    <p>Relatively few businesses can realistically expect to float as they are unlikely to be able to finance the necessary growth to attract investors.</p>
    <h3>Venture capital investment</h3>
    <p>An alternative to stock market flotation is to attract venture capital investment. Venture capital firms or private investors provide medium to long-term finance to your business in exchange for a share in the company. Venture capital funding can be used to grow or develop the business but may also be a way to facilitate an exit from your business by way of a management buy-out or buy-in or via a stock market flotation.</p>
    <p>It is important to check exactly what return a venture capital firm is expecting, how they plan to realise their investment and eventually exit the business. See our guides on <a href="/finance-and-grants/finance-options/shares-and-equity-finance/equity-finance.php" title="What equity finance is and how to find it">equity finance</a> and <a href="/finance-and-grants/finance-options/shares-and-equity-finance/venture-capital.php" title="How the venture capital investment model applies to small and medium-sized businesses seeking funding">venture capital</a>.</p>
    <p>Once you have secured funding you'll need to build a record over a number of years of delivering strong earnings and profits - and develop a business plan showing how you'll achieve further rapid growth.</p>
    <h3>Business suitability</h3>
    <p>Steps to take to be a suitable business for a flotation or venture capital investment include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>building a strong management team</li>
        <li>have a robust business plan outlining how growth and profits will be achieved</li>
        <li>setting up a limited company</li>
        <li>developing operational, financial and management systems robust enough to handle both rapid growth and the additional legal requirements of a listed business</li>
        <li>appointing high-quality financial advisers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because flotations are unsuitable for most businesses, it is important to consider other exit options - a trade sale could be a better alternative. For more information on trade sales, see the page in this guide on the <a href="detail8cf1.html?itemId=1073792648&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="Developing key business characteristics that will make a sale to another business more likely">exit option: selling your business</a>.</p>
