			<h1>Here's how a good balance sheet helped me to improve my business</h1>
			<h2>Here's how a good balance sheet helped me to improve my business</h2>
			<p>Sandeep Sud is a qualified solicitor who also runs a school uniform business based in Hounslow, in partnership with his parents. The company, which has four full-time employees, uses its balance sheet to gauge how the business is progressing. It's also been a key factor in securing a bank loan for the improvement and expansion of the company premises.</p>
			<p><strong>What I did</strong></p>
			<h3>Kept an eye on changing figures</h3>
			<p>"As a partnership we produce a balance sheet as part of our annual accounts and as an internal management exercise.</p>
			<p>"A balance sheet gives a snapshot of how the business is doing at a particular time. This is useful, but you have to remember that it could change overnight. For example, if you were in debt on April 30 when you did your year-end accounts, but paid this off on May 1, you would get a completely different picture of the strength of the business."</p>
			<h3>Looked at our profit and loss figures</h3>
			<p>"The balance sheet is useful when looked at alongside the profit and loss figures because then you get the whole picture. For example, if you borrowed lots in one particular year, but had made a profit, the profit would show on your profit and loss accounts, but what you owed would only be apparent on the balance sheet. It's important to be aware of both sets of numbers."</p>
			<h3>Used the balance sheet to secure a loan</h3>
			<p>"Having a strong balance sheet helped when it came to borrowing. When we first applied for a refurbishment loan we couldn't provide up-to-date accounts to the bank manager. This could have been a problem, but we quickly got our accounts in order and the loan was approved straight away. Because our balance sheet was strong, the bank thought we were a good risk. Although we decided not to draw down on the loan - because we used cashflow instead - it did open our eyes to the importance of a strong balance sheet."</p>
			<p><strong>What I'd do differently</strong></p>
			<p>"I would have taken the bank loan to drive expansion. In the past we've taken a cautious view of our balance sheet and so never taken the full amount of money available to us, when really the decision to borrow should be based on the risks and rewards of the project. Your balance sheet is essential, but don't let it rule your decision making."</p>

							<li>
								"Pay your creditors - especially suppliers - as soon as possible. This not only helps your balance sheet but also improves your bargaining position."
							</li>
							<li>
								"Consider off-balance sheet financing if appropriate eg for leased vehicles. This will improve the asset side of your balance sheet."
							</li>
							<li>
								"Never have too much cash in hand. If you are cash rich this will show on your balance sheet and you should move this money to a high-interest bank account."<br />
