			<h1>Choose an insurance adviser and present your risk</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<img src="/_img/HS1000.gif" width="94" height="62" alt="" />
			<p>As a business owner and/or employer you will probably use <strong>two types of insurance adviser</strong>. You will need to identify the type of insurance you need so that you can find a suitable broker for your business.</p>
			<p>General and commercial risk insurances are dealt with by an <strong>insurance intermediary</strong>, sometimes referred to as an insurance broker. An insurance intermediary deals with a number of insurance companies and may be able to secure a better deal for you. Some insurance intermediaries are agents of only a small number of insurance companies and will only offer you insurance with one of those companies. You should ask the insurance intermediary how extensive a search of the insurance market they will undertake on your behalf.</p>
			<p>Life assurance, protection and health insurance are dealt with by <strong>independent financial advisers</strong> (IFAs). Insurance brokers and IFAs act as intermediaries between you and an insurance company.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, you can contact insurance companies directly, but you might find it easier to use an insurance broker or IFA.</p>
			<p>This guide explains the issues involved in choosing both types of adviser and how to present your risk details. The guide deals mainly with insurances related to health and safety in the workplace. Other types of insurance are looked at in more detail in further guides in our section on <a href="layerd229.html?topicId=1087348745" title="Find out what types of insurance you need for your business">insurance</a>.</p>
