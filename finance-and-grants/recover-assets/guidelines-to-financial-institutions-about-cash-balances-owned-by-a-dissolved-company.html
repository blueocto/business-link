			<h1>Guidelines to financial institutions about cash balances owned by a dissolved company</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>When a registered company is dissolved before its members have transferred its assets out of the company, all of its property and rights pass to the Crown as ownerless property or 'bona vacantia'. It is then dealt with by the Treasury Solicitor.</p>
			<p>Normally, the Crown gives up its right to the property - ie it is disclaimed - or the property is sold and the proceeds of sale go to the Exchequer to be dealt with in the same way as money raised by general taxation. These assets often include credit balances held in bank or building society accounts.</p>
			<p>If the Treasury Solicitor receives money previously owned by a dissolved company, in certain circumstances, the former members - such as shareholders or a former liquidator - may be able to apply for a discretionary payment from that money.</p>
			<p>This guide explains what to do if you receive enquiries from former members or a former liquidator about how to apply for discretionary payments, and how to refer a credit balance to the Treasury Solicitor.</p>
