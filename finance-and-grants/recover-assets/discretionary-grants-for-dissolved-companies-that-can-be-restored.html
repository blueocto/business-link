			<h1>Discretionary grants for dissolved companies that can be restored</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>When a company is dissolved, all its property - but not its liabilities - pass to the Crown as ownerless property or 'bona vacantia'. The Crown can give part or all of it away by a grant from the Treasury Solicitor. This power is discretionary.</p>
			<p>This guide gives you information about the Treasury Solicitor's role in grants from bona vacantia. It tells you how to apply for a discretionary grant where it is possible to restore a company, what proof of identity and documents you will need and additional information to help you with your application.</p>
			<p>This guide only applies if the company can be restored to the Companies Register. For companies that cannot be restored to the Companies Register, see our guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/recover-assets/discretionary-grants-for-dissolved-companies-that-cannot-be-restored.php" title="How to apply for a discretionary grant from a dissolved company that cannot be restored to the Companies Register">discretionary grants for dissolved companies that cannot be restored</a>.</p>
			<p>This guide contains detailed guidance intended for those who wish to apply for a discretionary grant. For basic guidance on dissolved company assets, bona vacantia, and the role of Treasury Solicitor, see our guide on <a href="layer89c2.html?topicId=1086611908" title="An overview of bona vacantia, what happens to dissolved company assets and the role of the Treasury Solicitor">dissolved company assets: the basics</a>.</p>
