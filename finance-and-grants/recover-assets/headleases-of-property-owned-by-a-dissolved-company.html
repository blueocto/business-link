			<h1>Headleases of property owned by a dissolved company</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>When a company is dissolved, all its property and assets pass to the control of the Treasury Solicitor. They then have the right to sell such properties.</p>
			<p>If you are a leaseholder in a property formerly owned by a dissolved company, you will have the opportunity to buy the headlease of a property, where underleases have been granted to occupying tenants.</p>
			<p>This guide explains how to apply to the Treasury Solicitor to buy a headlease of a building divided into flats, where under-leases have been granted and explains the documentation and conditions involved. For basic guidance on dissolved company assets, bona vacantia, and the role of the Treasury Solicitor, see our guide on <a href="layer89c2.html?topicId=1086611908" title="An overview of bona vacantia, what happens to dissolved company assets and the role of the Treasury Solicitor">dissolved company assets: the basics</a>.</p>
