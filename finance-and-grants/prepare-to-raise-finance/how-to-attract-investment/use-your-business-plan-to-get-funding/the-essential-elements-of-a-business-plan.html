	<h1>Use your business plan to get funding</h1>
	<h2>The essential elements of a business plan</h2>
	<p><strong>Potential investors</strong> and <strong>lenders</strong> will look closely at your business plan to help them decide whether to risk their money.</p>
	<p>There is no standard format but most plans include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			An <strong>executive summary</strong> highlighting the main points - to catch people's attention.
		</li>
		<li>
			Details of key personnel with an organisational chart showing individual responsibilities.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Market research</strong> - details of competitors and how your product or service fits into the market - eg who your potential customers are and why you think they will buy your product or service.
		</li>
		<li>
			Your <strong>marketing plan</strong> - how you are going to get your product or service in front of potential customers, together with any assumptions made when setting your targets.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Financial information</strong> - eg key ratios. These can be used to compare your business' performance against industry benchmarks. It's also a good idea to give details of any major expenditure you have made on long-term assets and explain the reasons behind any changes in working capital items, such as stock, debtors and creditors. Remember to include balance sheet and profit and loss account details. Many lenders ask for three years' financial information. If this is not available, supply details about trading to date.
		</li>
		<li>
			How you will manage credit, expenditure, stock planning and control, and debtors and creditors.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You can read more about creating a business plan in our guide to how to <a href="layer5019.html?topicId=1073869162" title="The essential role that creating and using a business plan plays in starting a successful new business">prepare a business plan</a>.</p>
	<p>When seeking <b>funding</b>, include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			A <strong>cashflow forecast</strong> indicating the amount of funding you need and why. For a start-up, include estimates of how much finance you will require for two to three years or until you start to make a profit. Indicate contingency funds that might be needed for rough patches. This is usually between 10 and 20 per cent of the total funding requirement. See our guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/manage-your-cashflow/cashflow-management-the-basics.php" title="How to manage your cashflow and avoid cash problems in your business">cashflow management: the basics</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Financial forecasts</strong> for a three to five-year period. Try to present this information in the same way as historical financial information, so that straightforward comparisons can be made.
		</li>
		<li>
			How a loan will be repaid, how investors can get their money back, and when.
		</li>
