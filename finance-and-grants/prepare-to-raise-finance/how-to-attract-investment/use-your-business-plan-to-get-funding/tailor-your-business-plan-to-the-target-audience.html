			<h1>Use your business plan to get funding</h1>
			<h2>Tailor your business plan to the target audience</h2>
			<p>A business plan serves a number of purposes and you may have to modify information depending on your target audience.</p>
			<p>Your <b>bank</b> will be interested in:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					how you intend to repay a loan or overdraft
				</li>
				<li>
					what you are going to do with the money
				</li>
				<li>
					how the loan will help the business to grow
				</li>
				<li>
					what other loan or debt commitments you have
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Most lenders operate a credit-scoring system. Make sure you give up-to-date and relevant information. A good relationship with your bank manager will not influence the credit score - the manager may have discretion to negotiate terms but not to change the decision itself.</p>
			<p>Tell <b>potential investors</b> about:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					what you are going to do with the money
				</li>
				<li>
					when and how you are going to pay it back
				</li>
				<li>
					the expected return
				</li>
				<li>
					your other sources of funding
				</li>
				<li>
					your management's track record
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Include a detailed forecast of your profits and cashflow.</p>
			<p>Indicate to <b>s</b><b>hareholders</b>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					the prospects for the share price
				</li>
				<li>
					how they may be able to sell their shares
				</li>
				<li>
					what dividend they can expect on their shares
				</li>
				<li>
					your management's track record
				</li>
				<li>
					what say they might have in the business
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Demonstrate how they can exit with positive returns within three to five years.</p>
			<p>Many businesses with growth potential fail to raise funds because they lack <strong>investment readiness</strong> - they do not understand the expectations of investors, cannot turn proposals into attractive opportunities or are unaware of financing sources.</p>
			<p>Common reasons why business plans and loan applications fail include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					a weak management team
				</li>
				<li>
					a flawed marketing plan
				</li>
				<li>
					unrealistic forecasts
				</li>
				<li>
					incomplete financial history
				</li>
				<li>
					poor presentation
				</li>
			</ul>
