			<h1>Cashflow management: the basics</h1>
			<h2>How to avoid problems in your cashflow</h2>
			<p>No matter how effective your negotiations with customers and suppliers, poor business practices can put your cashflow at risk.</p>
			<p>However, there are some practices you could introduce into your business to reduce the risk of cashflow problems. For example, you should think about:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Running credit checks on your customers</strong> to ensure they can pay you on time - see our guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/debt-recovery/ensuring-customers-pay-you-on-time.php" title="Actions you can take if a payment you are due is late">ensuring customers pay you on time</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Whether you can fulfil your order</strong> - if you don't deliver on time, or to specification, you might not get paid. You should measure your production efficiency and the quantity and quality of the stock you hold and produce to ensure you can meet all your orders.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>How effective your marketing strategy is</strong>, especially if your sales are stagnating or falling - see our guides on how to <a href="/sales-and-marketing/marketing/create-your-marketing-strategy.php" title="Decide how to market your product or service to potential customers">create your marketing strategy</a> and <a href="/sales-and-marketing/keeping-your-customers/reach-your-customers-effectively.php" title="How to decide which sales channels to use to reach your customers">how to reach your customers effectively</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>How easy it is for your customers to do business with you</strong>. For example, if you could accept orders over the telephone, email or internet, customers may be able to pay quicker. You should also ensure catalogues and order forms are clear and easy to use to improve the sales and payment processes.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Keeping up-to-date accounting records</strong> to help warn you of any impending cashflow crises or prevent you from taking orders you can't handle. See our guides on how to <a href="/finance-and-grants/manage-your-cashflow/identify-potential-cashflow-problems.php" title="How to use cashflow forecasts and business plans to avoid financial problems">identify potential cashflow problems</a> and how to <a href="/finance-and-grants/financial-planning-and-accounts/avoid-the-problem-of-overtrading.php" title="How expanding businesses can match production and order cycles using gearing, working capital or quick ratio tests">avoid the problems of overtrading</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>How you work with your suppliers</strong> - make sure they are not be overcharging or taking too long to deliver. See our guide on how to <a href="/grow-your-business/growth-through-strategic-sourcing/manage-your-suppliers.php" title="How to get the most from your suppliers">manage your suppliers</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Controlling your overheads</strong> - you could consider outsourcing non-core activities such as payroll services or review your utilities contracts to see whether it would be cheaper to switch tariff or supplier.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Sometimes after doing all you can, your cashflow forecast may still suggest potential cashflow problems. You should consider using temporary finance facilities such as an overdraft or credit card to see you through. Having a cashflow forecast to demonstrate the shortfall is temporary and will reassure finance providers.</p>
