			<h1>Cashflow management: the basics</h1>
			<h2>How to measure and improve your cashflow</h2>
			<p>Ideally, you will have more money flowing into the business than out. This will allow you to build up <strong>cash balances</strong> to deal with short-term costs - such as bills or expenses - as well as funding growth and reassuring lenders and investors about the health of your business.</p>
			<p>However, income and expenditure cashflows rarely occur together - cash inflows often lag behind, so it is important to maintain enough cash in your business to deal with day-to-day running costs. Your aim should be to speed up the inflows and slow down the outflows wherever possible.</p>
			<p>Cash inflows include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>payment for goods or services from your customers</li>
				<li>receipt of a bank loan or increased loans or overdrafts</li>
				<li>interest on savings and investments</li>
				<li>shareholder investments</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Cash outflows include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>purchase of stock, raw materials or tools</li>
				<li>wages, rents and daily operating expenses</li>
				<li>purchase of fixed assets - PCs, machinery, office furniture, etc.</li>
				<li>loan repayments</li>
				<li>
					dividend payments
				</li>
				<li>
					Income tax, Corporation Tax, VAT, National Insurance contributions, etc
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Many of your regular cash outflows will need to be made on fixed dates. So you must always be in a position to meet these payments in order to avoid large fines or a disgruntled workforce.</p>
			<h3>Improving your cashflow</h3>
			<p>To improve everyday cashflow you could:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ask your customers to <strong>pay sooner</strong> - see our guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/manage-your-cashflow/invoicing-and-payment-terms.php" title="How to devise payment terms and an invoicing system to maintain a healthy cashflow">invoicing and payment terms</a></li>
				<li><strong>chase debts</strong> promptly and firmly - see our guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/debt-recovery/ensuring-customers-pay-you-on-time.php" title="Actions you can take if a payment you are due is late">ensuring customers pay you on time</a></li>
				<li>use <strong>factoring</strong> - see our guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/manage-your-cashflow/factoring-and-invoice-discounting-the-basics.php" title="How to improve cashflow by selling your invoices to a third party before the invoices are paid by your customers">factoring and invoice discounting: the basics</a></li>
				<li>ask for <strong>extended credit</strong> terms from suppliers - see our guide on how to <a href="layerc3fe.html?topicId=1074404815" title="How to negotiate a purchase effectively, using your bargaining power to get value for money">negotiate the right deal with suppliers</a></li>
				<li>order <strong>less stock</strong> but more often - see our guides on <a href="layer5793.html?topicId=1074039371" title="Why stock control is important and the different methods of stock control available to you">stock control and inventory</a> and <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/use-innovation-in-your-business/manufacturing-innovation.php" title="How new practices can improve business, what new technologies and thinking offer and where to go for further help">manufacturing innovation</a></li>
				<li>increase your sales and profitability - see our guides on how to <a href="/grow-your-business/planning-how-to-grow/increase-your-market-share.php" title="How to increase sales and profit from existing customers, break into new markets and increase your overall share">increase your market share</a> and <a href="layer3a23.html?topicId=1079681521" title="How to make better profits by assessing, controlling and managing your business processes more effectively">increase your profitability</a></li>

			<p>You can also improve your cashflow by <strong>borrowing money</strong>, or <strong>investing more money</strong> into the business. This can help you cope with short-term cash problems or fund short-term growth, but it is important not to rely on these in your cash strategy.
