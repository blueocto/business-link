			<h1>Cashflow management: the basics</h1>
			<h2>Cashflow forecasts</h2>
			<p>Cashflow forecasting enables you to predict peaks and troughs in your cash balance. It helps you to plan how much and when to borrow and how much available cash you're likely to have at a given time. Many banks require cashflow forecasts before considering a loan.</p>
			<h3>Elements of a cashflow forecast</h3>
			<p>The cashflow forecast identifies the sources and amounts of cash coming into your business and the destinations and amounts of cash going out over a given period. There are normally two columns, listing forecast and actual amounts respectively.</p>
			<p>The forecast is usually done for a year or quarter in advance and divided into weeks or months. In extremely difficult cashflow situations, a daily cashflow forecast might be useful. It is best to pick periods during which most of your fixed costs - such as salaries - go out. The forecast should list:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					receipts - any money that will come in during that period
				</li>
				<li>
					payments - any money that will go out during that period
				</li>
				<li>
					excess of receipts over payments - with negative figures shown in brackets
				</li>
				<li>
					bank balance at the start of the period
				</li>
				<li>
					bank balance at the end of the period
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is important to be <strong>realistic</strong> in your forecast - see our guide on how to <a href="layer0cd7.html?topicId=1073901350" title="How to use sales forecasting to improve your understanding and management of your business">forecast and plan your sales</a>.</p>
			<p>You could separate cashflow for business operations from funding cashflow. This will give you a clearer picture of the actual performance of your business, by allowing you to gauge how self-sufficient the day-to-day working of your business is. A net outflow in operational cashflow is usually an indicator of problems that need to be addressed quickly.</p>
			<p>If you have an established business, it is often a good idea to base your sales prediction on the same period 12 months earlier.</p>

			<p>Note that all forecast figures must relate to sums that are due to be collected and paid out, not invoices actually sent and received. The forecast will also need adjusting in line with long-term changes to actual performance or market trends.</p>
			<p>Accounting software can help you prepare your cashflow forecast, allowing you to update your projections if there's a change in market trends or your business.
