			<h1>Cashflow management: the basics</h1>
			<h2>How to measure cash in your business</h2>
			<p>Every business needs cash available in order to pay their bills and expenses on time, so it is important to balance the <strong>timing</strong> and <strong>amount</strong> of money flowing into and out of your business each week and month.</p>
			<p>'Cash' is the amount of money available to your business - including coins, notes, money in your bank account, any unused overdraft facility and foreign currency and deposits that can be quickly converted into your currency.</p>
			<p>Cash does not include any money or value owned by the business that cannot be accessed quickly - eg long-term deposits that cannot be quickly withdrawn, money owed to your business by customers, stock or assets.</p>
			<p>In order to make a profit, most businesses have to produce and deliver goods or services to their customers before being paid. So it is essential to control your cashflow so that you always have enough cash available to pay your staff and suppliers before receiving payment from your customers. If not, you'll be unable to meet your customers' requirements or receive any profit.</p>
			<p>It is important not to confuse your 'cash balances' with profit. Profit is the difference between the total amount your business earns and all of its costs, usually assessed over a year or a specified trading period. You may forecast a good profit for the year, yet still face times when you are strapped for cash. For more information, see our guide on how to <a href="/finance-and-grants/manage-your-cashflow/identify-potential-cashflow-problems.php" title="How to use cashflow forecasts and business plans to avoid financial problems">identify potential cashflow problems</a>.</p>
			<p>However, having a lot of cash in your bank account may not always be the best thing for your business. If you have a lot of spare cash available, it can sometimes be a good idea to move it to another account with a higher interest rate, or use it as capital for short-term investments. Choosing the right bank account/s for your business is very important, so it is recommended that you seek professional advice from your bank, accountant or financial adviser.</p>
