			<h1>Cashflow management: the basics</h1>
			<h2>Manage your income and expenditure</h2>
			<p>Effective cashflow management is critical to business survival. It is therefore important to reduce the time gap between expenditure and receipt of income to ensure you always have the necessary cash to pay for your day-to-day business costs.</p>
			<h3>Customer management</h3>
			<p>Ensuring your customers pay you on time and in full is vital to maintaining healthy cashflow. To aid this, you should:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Define a <strong>credit policy</strong> that clearly sets out your standard <strong>payment terms</strong> - see our guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/manage-your-cashflow/invoicing-and-payment-terms.php" title="How to devise payment terms and an invoicing system to maintain a healthy cashflow">invoicing and payment terms</a>.</li>
				<li>Issue invoices promptly, and chase outstanding payments regularly - see our guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/debt-recovery/ensuring-customers-pay-you-on-time.php" title="Actions you can take if a payment you are due is late">ensuring customers pay you on time</a>.</li>
				<li>Consider charging <strong>penalty interest</strong> for late payment <a href="/_files/a-users-guide-to-late-payment-legislation_apr-2002.pdf" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="A User's guide to the late payment legislation">- download the guide to late payment legislation guidance from the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (BIS) website (PDF, 390K)</a>. You can also <a href="/finance-and-grants/debt-recovery/calculate-the-interest-due-on-an-unpaid-debt.php" title="Interactive tool to calculate the statutory or contractual interest you may be able to charge">use our interactive tool to calculate statutory or contractual interest you may be able to charge on an unpaid debt</a>.</li>
				<li>Consider offering <strong>discounts</strong> for prompt payment.</li>
				<li>Negotiate <strong>deposits</strong> or <strong>staged payments</strong> for large contracts.</li>
				<li>
					Maintain a good relationship with your customers so that you can see any signs that they are in trouble as early as possible. See the page on <a href="detail5542.html?itemId=1073791114&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="The importance of staying aware of your customers' financial situation">how to know when your customers are in trouble</a> in our guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/manage-your-cashflow/identify-potential-cashflow-problems.php" title="How to use cashflow forecasts and business plans to avoid financial problems">how to identify potential cashflow problems</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Supplier management</h3>
			<p>You could ask your suppliers for <strong>extended credit</strong> terms. Giving your suppliers incentives such as large or regular orders may help, but make sure you have a market for the orders you're placing. Alternatively, you could consider <strong>reducing stock levels</strong> and using <strong>just-in-time</strong> systems - see our guide on <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/use-innovation-in-your-business/manufacturing-innovation.php" title="How new practices can improve business, what new technologies and thinking offer and where to go for further help">manufacturing innovation</a>.</p>
			<p>For more information, see our guides on <a href="layer5793.html?topicId=1074039371" title="Why stock control is important and the different methods of stock control available to you">stock control and inventory</a> and how to <a href="/grow-your-business/growth-through-strategic-sourcing/manage-your-suppliers.php" title="How to get the most from your suppliers">manage your suppliers</a>.</p>
			<h3>Taxation</h3>
			<p>As a business, you may be liable for several taxes including Income Tax, Corporation Tax, VAT, business rates and stamp duty. It is important to keep good records to help you calculate your liability and complete your returns accurately. See our guide on how to <a href="layer646d.html?topicId=1073860617" title="What you need to record and for how long, with step-by-step guidance on setting up your own system">set up a basic record-keeping system</a>.</p>
			<p>If you are registered for VAT, it makes sense to buy major items at the end rather than the start of a VAT period. This can often improve your cashflow, because you can offset the VAT on the purchase against the VAT you charge on sales. This may help you to manage a temporary cashflow gap.</p>
			<p>If you are concerned that you may not be able to pay amounts that are owed or will soon be owed to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC), you can contact the HMRC Business Payment Support Service Helpline on Tel 0845 302 1435. HMRC staff will review your situation and discuss temporary payment arrangements tailored to your business' circumstances.</p>
			<p>See our guide on the <a href="layer2591.html?topicId=1085164054" title="Contact HMRC before your payment is due - if you think you're going to have difficulties paying in full and on time">Business Payment Support Service</a>.</p>
			<h3>Asset management</h3>
			<p>You could also consider leasing fixed assets - eg equipment - or buying them on hire purchase. Buying assets outright can place a huge drain on cash in the early years of business, so it can sometimes be more cost-effective to lease them instead. See our guide on how to <a href="/finance-and-grants/manage-your-cashflow/decide-whether-to-lease-or-buy-assets.php" title="The pros and cons of leasing and buying outright">decide whether to lease or buy assets</a>.</p>
