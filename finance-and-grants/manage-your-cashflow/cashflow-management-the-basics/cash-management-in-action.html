			<h1>Cashflow management: the basics</h1>
			<h2>Cash management in action</h2>
			<p>The following <strong>simple example</strong> shows how a small, profitable business can run into unforeseen cashflow problems when it takes on a new large order.</p>
			<p>XYZ manufacturer is a small but profitable gift designer and supplier with three full-time staff (including the two owners). It outsources production, but supplies the raw materials itself to save on costs. It then finishes and packages the final product on site.</p>
			<p>XYZ does not have any loans or overdrafts. It has a long-term customer base of small gift shops and visitor centres.</p>
			<p>XYZ suddenly wins a large order to supply bespoke wall plaques for a chain of stores. The contract promises to double XYZ's turnover.</p>
			<p>The team takes on an additional employee and works flat out to meet the deadlines. It doesn't notice an impending <strong>cashflow crisis</strong> resulting from a fall in repeat orders from existing customers, combined with a jump in raw material costs.</p>
			<p>To make matters worse, the new client keeps changing its mind about designs. A misunderstanding means the first run of goods is rejected, causing a delay in payment and increased production costs. XYZ orders additional materials to make up the shortfall in the run.</p>
			<p>By the time the order is complete, XYZ is running an expensive overdraft. Profit margins have been squeezed to the limit and it has lost several of its existing customers. A downturn in the fortunes of the retail chain means that it doesn't place any further orders.</p>
			<p>After a lot of hard work, XYZ finds itself back where it was five years earlier.</p>
			<p>Tighter cashflow management would have highlighted the fall in repeat orders and rise in raw material costs. XYZ would also have benefited from a client contract that included:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>milestone payments and penalty provisions for changes such as those to designs - eg increased fees</li>
				<li>sharing the cost of additional materials with the new client or getting the client to pay for them</li>
			</ul>
