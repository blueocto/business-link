			<h1>Invoicing and payment terms</h1>
			<h2>Setting terms and conditions</h2>
			<p>Terms and conditions - sometimes known as terms of trade - are the terms of the contract between you and your customers. They're designed to <strong>protect your rights</strong>, <strong>limit your liabilities</strong> and provide you with some <strong>security</strong> when you sell your goods or provide a service.</p>
			<p>Many businesses supply goods and services on the basis of informal, verbal arrangements. However, if agreements are clearly set out in writing then there is less chance of a dispute arising.</p>
			<p>It's important to get your terms and conditions right - if they're inadequate or incorrect, it can be difficult to pursue or prevent bad debt. You could use different terms and conditions for each order, but it can be beneficial to have standard terms for all your transactions. If you decide to draft standard terms, it is a good idea to consult a <strong>solicitor</strong>.</p>
			<p>Your terms and conditions should cover information on costs, delivery arrangements, data protection and your right to charge interest on late payments.</p>
			<p>You should also incorporate payment terms into your standard contract for all the payment options you offer - eg full payment, part payment in advance or payment in arrears. You could also offer customers a discount for paying before the invoice due date to encourage early payment. See the page in this guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/manage-your-cashflow/invoicing-and-payment-terms/setting-suitable-payment-terms-for-your-customers.php" title="Payment terms are crucial to your cashflow and competitive position and should be explained clearly to customers">setting suitable payment terms for your customers</a>.</p>
			<p>There are other terms and conditions your may want to cover, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>retention of title - allows you to retain ownership of goods already supplied until they are paid for</li>
				<li>time limits for raising a dispute</li>
				<li>circumstances in which the contract might be breached or come to an end</li>
				<li>contra and offset deals against payables - where the buyer pays you in part or full with their products rather than in cash</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You may also want to include a clause in your contract regarding credit limits and credit periods. There is currently an automatic default period of 30 days if you do not account for this in your contract. For more information, see our guide on <a href="layer861a.html?topicId=1074002362" title="Actions you can take if a payment you are due is late">ensuring customers pay you on time</a>.</p>
			<h3>Make your terms binding</h3>
			<p>You need to make your customers aware of, and agree to, your terms and conditions. You can do this by printing them on the back of invoices, delivery notes and other documentation.</p>
			<p>Explain your terms and conditions to customers at the start of your relationship and allow them to discuss with you any problems they have before you raise an invoice. When you do raise an invoice ensure your terms and conditions are included.</p>
