			<h1>Invoicing and payment terms</h1>
			<h2>Information that invoices must contain</h2>
			<p>When issuing an invoice, you must clearly display the word 'invoice' on the document. In addition to this, you must include the following information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a unique identification number</li>
				<li>your company name, address and contact information</li>
				<li>the company name and address of the customer you are invoicing</li>
				<li>a clear description of what you are charging for</li>
				<li>the date the goods or service were provided (supply date)</li>
				<li>the date of the invoice</li>
				<li>the amount(s) being charged</li>
				<li>VAT amount if applicable</li>
				<li>the total amount owed</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you are a limited company or a sole trader you must also provide certain information on any invoices you send.</p>
			<p>If you are VAT-registered, there are further details your invoices must include. For more information, see the page in this guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/manage-your-cashflow/invoicing-and-payment-terms/vat-details-to-include-on-invoices.php" title="VAT-registered businesses must include extra information on invoices, such as identifying numbers and VAT paid">VAT details to include on invoices</a>.</p>
			<h3>Limited companies' invoices</h3>
			<p>Limited companies <b>must</b> have the following additional information on their invoices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the full company name as it appears on the certificate of incorporation</li>
				<li>any business name used in your business</li>
				<li>an address where any legal documents can be delivered to you if you are using a business name</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Limited companies <b>may</b> include the names of the directors on their invoices. However, if you are going to publish this information on your invoices, you must include the names of <b>all</b> directors.</p>
			<h3>Sole traders' invoices</h3>
			<p>A sole trader <b>must</b> have the following additional information on their invoices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the trader's name or any business name being used</li>
				<li>an address where any legal documents can be delivered to you if you are using a business name</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Interest charged on late payments</h3>
			<p>You have a statutory right to charge interest under the late payment legislation and may wish to include the following wording:</p>
			<p>"We will exercise our statutory right to claim interest (at 8 per cent over the Bank of England base rate) and compensation for debt recovery costs under the Late Payment legislation if we are not paid according to our agreed credit terms."</p>
			<p>You do not have to charge interest, however this may provide an incentive to customers to pay you promptly. For more information, see the page on <a href="detail4943.html?itemId=1073792170&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="You have a statutory right to charge interest on any money owed to your business">charging interest on late payments</a> in our guide to <a href="layer861a.html?topicId=1074002362" title="Actions you can take if a payment you are due is late">ensuring customers pay you on time</a>.</p>
