			<h1>Decide whether to lease or buy assets</h1>
			<h2>Buying equipment outright</h2>
			<p>Buying equipment outright may at first seem like the best option, but it's always a good idea to think about whether this makes best use of your working capital. It may be more cost-effective to rent or lease certain items.</p>
			<p>There are several <b>advantages</b> of buying equipment outright. It means you:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>fully <strong>own</strong> the asset - unless you have used it as security for a loan</li>
				<li>are treated as the owner for <b>tax purposes</b> and can claim capital allowances</li>
				<li>don't tie your business into long-term agreements which may be difficult to end</li>
				<li>will <strong>pay less</strong> overall than you would through a lease or hire purchase agreement</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, there are also several potential <strong>disadvantages</strong> of buying equipment outright:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you have to pay the <b>full cost</b> of the asset up front which can affect your cashflow</li>
				<li>you may need to use an overdraft or loan to fund the purchase - overdrafts can be withdrawn at short notice and in some cases early repayment of loans can be demanded</li>
				<li>small businesses might not get the same price as bigger businesses</li>
				<li>if you do not have good product knowledge and experience you could make an unwise choice and you may end up buying equipment you don't need</li>
				<li>you can't easily <b>spread the cost</b> to coincide with money coming into the business</li>
				<li>you are entirely responsible for the <b>maintenance and repair</b> of the asset, which can be a risk if the equipment breaks down or needs replacing</li>
				<li>you won't be able to take advantage of the tax benefits of deducting the cost of rental from your taxable income</li>
				<li>the value of the asset may depreciate over time and be worth less than you paid for it - see the page in this guide on <a href="/finance-and-grants/manage-your-cashflow/decide-whether-to-lease-or-buy-assets/understanding-depreciation-of-assets.php" title="The value of assets falls over time and can be written off in accounts spreading the cost over several tax years">understanding depreciation of assets</a> </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Tax implications</h3>
			<p>As with leasing arrangements, there also are tax reliefs for buying assets outright. For more information, see the page on <a href="detaila90f.html?itemId=1073791583&amp;type=RESOURCES" title="Information on the tax reliefs available when buying or leasing assets, and the rules for VAT ">tax relief for buying or leasing assets</a> in our guide on how to <a href="layer33bb.html?topicId=1073959000" title="Tax efficient methods of borrowing and how they can apply to your business">acquire assets and borrow money tax efficiently</a>.</p>
