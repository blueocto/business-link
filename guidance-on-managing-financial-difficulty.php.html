	<h2>New guidance on handling and avoiding insolvency</h2>
	<p>Our finance and grants section now contains information on how to deal with financial difficulty.</p>
	<p>This guidance provides information on how to avoid insolvency and what your options and obligations are if you do find yourself in financial difficulty.</p>
	<p>If you cannot pay your debts, or if your business' debts are greater than the value of its assets, then you are, or your business is, insolvent. If you cannot pay these debts quickly, then your insolvency may lead to bankruptcy or your business being wound up.</p>
	<p>Insolvency is a complex and sensitive subject, but there are steps you can take that may help you to manage your cashflow and avoid insolvency. For more information, see our:</p>
