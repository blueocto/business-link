				<h1>Submit an idea to the Better Regulation Executive</h1>
				<h3>Submit your idea</h3>
				<p>This page links you to the 'submit your idea' tool provided by the Better Regulation Executive.</p>
				<p>Businesses can have a direct influence on how the regulations that affect them are devised and delivered.<br />
					All you have to do is submit your proposal outlining how a certain regulation can be improved. Suggestions can include cutting the amount of time you spend filling in forms, ideas on where regulations that overlap or contradict can be rationalised or regulations, which in your view, are unnecessary.</p>
