            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <img src="/_img/supply_chain.gif" width="78" height="118" alt="" />
            <p>If you are serious about reducing the environmental impact of your business, it's essential that you work in close partnership with your suppliers to ensure that they maintain their own high environmental standards. As a supplier, you should also help your customers to meet their environmental targets.</p>
            <p>There can be significant cost benefits from being environmentally aware. Reducing energy consumption, raw materials, waste production and waste disposal can all have a major impact on the profit your business makes. By working together with other organisations in your supply chain you can help to ensure that you each operate efficiently and keep your impact on the environment to a minimum.</p>
            <p>This guide explains what impact an effective supply-chain partnership can have and how suppliers can be managed in a spirit of co-operation and partnership. It also shows how suppliers can contribute to the process through positive action, by meeting independent standards for sustainability and environmental awareness.</p>
